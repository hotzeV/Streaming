Thanks, Titania!","Buckdarmha","1472130847","R21D8ZJSXS19S5","1554975375","I already lack the strength to buy and read this book, since the descriptions of its contents has caused me to realize what a terrible person I must be. As a cis-white male of the male gender persuasion I have tried to live my life every day as an advocate for those who are not like me. Years ago, I thought that by adapting disadvantaged black and hispanic orphans that I might help them improve their lives and in some small way exonerate my race from being the Worst of All Time (WOAT). But the first sentences from the book description made me realize the irredeemable sin of trying to be kind and help people while being white. Now I cannot bear to even look at my children.",5

The kind that stays with you. I follow the Man Booker nominees and winner and bought this book while on vacation in Ireland. I admit it was slow going at first. Please put yourself in the mindset of an 18 year old and let the prose envelope your own teenage memories as you experience the young girl's thoughts you are sharing. When I would pick up the book to continue delving into the next chapter I was terrified for her yet admired her strength and intelligence. I suggest when you finish the last page, do yourself a favor and read the first chapter again, magical. Thank you, Anna Burns.",5

"10","Cemetery Road: A Novel","Great Book Mr. Iles!","BeMa","0062824619","R10VJ8JX3YNVPH","1554976266","I enjoy reading a lot of authors, Greg Iles is definitely one of those. I really like Greg Iles characters, they are never perfect and Marshall isn't perfect (unlike the rest of us right?), they feel so realistic though. Marshall has been through a lot of loss that lays heavily on him. Add more on top of it, a man who was like a Father to him has been murdered and Marshall is looking to discover who did it, his love of his life is married to his best friend who happened to save his life...now I could go on and on. A lot going on in this book. Greg Iles hits another out of the park.  Oh and P.S. there is no Trump bashing as others have commented.  He was working in D.C. on the investigation as a journalist.  Come on people.",5
"11","Cemetery Road: A Novel","Thrilling Insightful page turner","Pembroke","0062824619","R2VBDHPOXGOA7Z","1554976746","Good insightful thriller.  Iles is a great story teller and he comes through strong in this novel!  I read ""Natches Burning"" and was so impressed with how he weaved in political historical facts in a fictional story; it read so believable that I decided to read this novel.  Just as in his earlier novels he includes today's sentiments towards politics and political figures, which will offend some readers who can't read objectively.  The story line at times felt it pulled in concepts from ""Natches Burning"" which is my reason for a 4 star rating.  Full of suspense, betrayal, wealth and power, and the corruption that consumes the arrogant... it will make you put today's political abuse in perspective.",4
"12","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","Delightful book","Jayhawk82","0143110438","R1Q062RVBF8SVQ","1554976817","A delightful book, full of plot twists and turns, as well as subleties of Russian history.  I can't recall a fiction book of recent vintage that I've enjoyed more.  I came to this book after reading Towles' ""Rules of Civility,""  which was also an enjoyable read, but not on the same level as ""A Gentleman in Moscow.""  Characters, especially the Count, are well developed and the story moves along at a brisk pace.  I am curious as to why Towles named each chapter beginning with the letter ""A"".  In any case, don't miss this one---it's a superb work.",5
"13","Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault: Essays from the Grown-up Years","Oh, How I can Relate","Monnie Ryan","0735218420","R38CBYF9J4SHVX","1554976959","I'm not sure which I did more of while reading this wonderful book: chuckle out loud or wipe away tears. It helps, I suppose, that I was a huge fan of the author's long-running ""Cathy"" comic strip. Perhaps more important, while I'm older than she is by nine years, I, too, was a champion of the feminist movement (still am, as is she) and was for a time sandwiched in between parents and a daughter, all of whom were growing old, and up, way too fast. Sadly, my parents are gone now - and my daughter has become the ""stuff"" inside the Oreo of life, caught between a grown daughter of her own and her aging parents (which, Lord help us, means me and my husband).

In any event, oh, how I can relate - and I'm quite sure all but teenybopper females will do so as well. These essays were written, Guisewite says, at a time when she's trying to ""declutter"" her own life (hmmm, I'm pretty sure that's a word that passed through our daughter's lips last time she popped in for a visit). Feminist though she may be, Guisewite admits to feeling torn between Betty Crocker and Betty Friedan (conjuring up decades-ago memories of whipping up a casserole for my family to eat while I attended a Gloria Steinem lecture). I choked with laughter - and frustration - as she recounted getting ""stuck"" in a sports bra; as a gym newbie, I can tell you it's not fun (though worse, perhaps, is the embarrassment over having to call someone to your rescue). And before I caved and joined the gym, I, too, resisted the call to exercise, rationalizing that ""I exercised yesterday and I don't look any different.""

There are far too many other shared feelings and experiences to mention here (especially since I don't want to spoil the fun for other readers). In the end, she sums up the dilemma we're in perfectly: ""My whole generation is reeling from the stunning truth - that we, who are way too young and hip to ever look or act old, are not too young to pass away."" Aha - maybe that's why I glance proudly at the year-old Aristocat tattoo on the top of my flip-flop clad foot as I open the morning newspaper first to the obituaries pages. Torn indeed!

In short, I love, love, love this book - highly recommended. Many thanks to the publisher, via NetGalley, for the opportunity to read and review an advance copy.",5

Yes, Greg did includeTrump comments and constant mention of his Flex, however, I don’t feel those issuesdetracted from the storyline...it’s a story, for heavens sake!

"18","Cemetery Road: A Novel","One Hell of a Story","A Southern Reader","0062824619","R38ETVQXZFZ1M1","1554977346","Isle's new book has it all.  A love triangle, murders, deaths of oved ones, a crusading journalist, Mississippi, really bad guys and really good guys, the Mississippi River, plot twists that won't stop, and a conclusion that doesn't strain belief.  I'm now waiting for the movie just like I was way back when I finished The Godfather.  And, the book is extremely well crafted with more than a few insights and thoughts that make you go, hmmm.  An unqualified five star recommendation.  And, on a related topic, the  Customer Reviews from the Trumpsters assembled who cannot ever seem to divorce anything from their frothing at the mouth defense of their idol.  The few passing references to Trump in the book are all well within the context of the book as the author establishes the time frame for the story.  Their recommendations to not buy the book should be completely disregarded.  The only downside to reading the book is that you will need to allot some of your life time as it is a real page turner right up to the end.",5

The photos are GORGEOUS, and the recipes look easy to make - which is great because I don't like spending hours cooking in my kitchen. But it's more than just a cookbook - to my surprise, the first 114 pages are filled with vital information about Hashimoto's, guides on how to address nutrient depletions, and more. I plan on showing this amazing book to my family, so they can finally understand Hashimoto's and the reasons why I choose to follow a thyroid-friendly diet... and maybe make me some thyroid-friendly meals, too! ;)",5

Confined to a tiny room in the attic, the Count nevertheless makes friends with the staff of the hotel, meets many who visit the hotel and has many adventures and interests portrayed against the backdrop of Russian history. Rather than letting his circumstances define him, the Count defines his circumstances with dignity, intelligence, kindness, curiosity and grace. More than one interesting character moves this story along and the Count’s philosophy and wisdom are interspersed throughout. There are lots of details regarding life in Russia after the revolution along with knowledge of the arts and fine living put to good use in creating a meaningful and fulfilling life. The ending is satisfying and appropriate. This novel is a keeper – one to reread and savor.",5

"33","Cemetery Road: A Novel","Thanks for saving me money. I’ll skip this one.","Lori Johnson","0062824619","R3SALKY25M5FBT","1554979146","My thanks to all the reviewers. I have been a dedicated Iles fan for years. I adore his early books and read them over and over.Sadly, I had started noticing with the most recent trilogy that his writing was beginning to be very bloated. Additionally, Greg was falling victim to feeling his role is to be a moral authority. I miss the old days when his books were an intelligent escape. I loved reading them and saying to myself “Didn’t see THAT coming.”  Now they are increasingly preachy and drawn out.After reading the reviews, I plan on saving my time and money on this one.  While the addition of politics into this book may have been an attempt to keep it timely and relevant, it really makes it dated. Many Iles fans reread his books over and over years after they have been written. Not sure the politics of this time will hold up as a good read in 10 years.Please, Greg, bring back the timeless. totally engrossing thrillers with unexpected plot twists we used to know.  I’ll gladly pay for entertainment and escape, not politics.  I hope the next one is better. Fingers crossed.",1

But I made quick work of this book, and probably will read it again, because of its thoughtful, thorough, concise presentation of the facts and history that made the greatest country ever dreamt of, and the motives of those who wish to destroy it.

An example would be The Gunslinger, but he is known mainly for horror stories.Louis and his family had just recently moved to Maine from Chicago. Louis and his family meet Jud Crandall who helps pull a stinger out of Gages neck. The house they moves to is near a large road which trucks go by a lot. They find a cemetery near their house with a sign that misspells cemetery. Gage is taught how to fly a kite and while they’re not paying attention something horrible happens.When writing this book Stephen King wrote this to show that playing god is a bad idea and that the actions you take will lead to consequences. The lesson was don’t try to fix what has been done and move on. When Louis buries Church the cat comes back alive but stinks, and hates him.I think this is a great book, I enjoyed reading it despite the amount of language. I think that Stephen King could have improved it by making his books for teenager friendly. Otherwise it would be nice if he didn’t use so much language.I would recommend Pet Sematary to teenagers and adults that are mature. The book being in the horror genre means it will have gore, blood, and profanity. If you are not ok with those things, this is not a book for you.",4

Yes the relationship between the main characters isn't what I would call healthy but that's what drew me in so much was the endless amount of drama. Two characters who are literally polar opposites of each other yet they have this incredible chemistry which as the reader drives you crazy and I found myself almost unable to put it down I just kept wanting to know what was going to happen next.

It at once showcases the ideals of the Russian revolution together with nostalgia for the loss of tradition and culture of the Tsarist era. It contrasts the evolving political cultures of the West versus their Soviet counterparts - highlighting important issues such as gender equality, efficiency, and economic planning, while at the same time, illustrating how the regime established for the collective good erased all measure of the importance of the individual.

I kept waiting for the supposed Trump bashing but it just didn't materialize.  The author may reference briefly the political climate, which seems fitting considering the 24/7 news cycle we live in and the division that many of us see and feel within the country and often our own families.

"96","Becoming Supernatural: How Common People…","Great with Several areas to Improve","Dane","1401953115","R1PWNAAVXFKNOP","1554985055","What's great:* Expanding the scientific paradigm to include what is currently considered supernatural.* Inspirational.How to improve:* 40% of this reads as an infomercial, self-referential in nature.* I think one of the most important things is to gather data of super-natural experiences within the group and outside the group. There is still a very weak hypothesis about why someone trying to grow for 1,3, or 20 years suddenly has an experience after 20 years vs. reliably day by day. This weak point, combined with a concentration of a few miraculous events over time in a group sampling of tens of thousands can create a blind spot:a) There is and always has been a small statistical amount of miraculous human experiences.b) What is much less clear is where and why these are concentrated. If you have 10,000 people all going to a workshop for healing, some of them would have had miraculous experiences in any context, some in one meditation practice, and some in another.c) What is lacking is a statistical sampling that scientifically records: 10,000 people all did the workshop (since all the miraculous things mentioned seem to occur in Joe's workshops) and each one wanted X miracle to occur. Of those 10,000 people how many got it in one workshop, how many in two or three workshops and how many never got their miracle. I think this is important in assessing the paradigm as a treatment, and then compare this with 10,000 people who wanted a miracle and did their own thing over the same amount of time.This experiment would allow someone considering Joe's protocols to say: There is a 4% chance that if I spend $15,000. on airfare and the like that I will have a miraculous experience. Or it's 6% - whatever the number. The next step is to continue to refine distinctions in who did/did not create a miracle based on objective data about thoughts, habits etc.",4

This is pantheism in a thin coat of Christianity. John 1 most clearly argues that Jesus is alone in being the Christ, and several places in the Gospels, Jesus warns about false Christ’s (Luke 21:8, Mark 13:6-22, and Matthew 24:5-26) He also calls Himself the Christ (The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.” Jesus said to her, “I who speak to you am he.”John 4:25-26) and never at anypoint does the Bible make refrence to a Christ Force if you will. Rohr also believes that the death of Jesus was not an atoning sacrafice for the sin ofMan even though there are many verses clearly stating that His death on the cross was for the atonement of mankind (2 Corinthians 5:21, 1 Peter 1:18-21, Acts 20:28, Colossians 1:18-23, Ephesians 1:3-14, Hebrews 9:11-28, the whole chapter of Hebrews 10, 1 John 1:5-10, Luke 22:20, the whole chapter of Romans 5, Romans 3:21-31, Revealtion 1:5-7, Revelation 7:13-17, Revelation 12:10-12, and Jesus Himself declared it to be so in Matthew 26:26-29)",1

He is in print and he is on TV. He has even won a Pulitzer prize for war reporting. Now he must return to Bienville, the small Mississippi town he is from as his father is terminally ill and he must tend to the business of running the family newspaper. When a man, who was his surrogate father is found murdered in the river, Marshall begins to look into the death. This leads him into a confrontation with the Poker Club, a group of powerful local businessmen who will apparently stop at nothing to get their way- including murder. To add to the complexity, Marshall begins to carry on an affair with Jet Matheson, the wife of his best friend from childhood.  It is obvious that no good can come from this.CEMETERY ROAD is another epic novel written in the same style as the NATCHEZ BURNING trilogy. Greg Iles creates a profoundly realistic setting from which to set his unique cast of characters. The author is brilliant at juxtaposing various storylines into each other from the present and the past. The traditions and secrets of a small Southern town come vividly to life. The plot is compelling, and the pages do move rapidly to the inevitable but satisfying conclusion. One point of criticism is the excessive expository dialogue near the end. So much of it seems unnecessary and given the extreme length of the book, there was plenty of room to divulge some of this material earlier.  It is still another great read by this incredibly prolific author. NOTE- there is considerable discussion about the politics in the book. Personally, I found it annoying but there is so much more to this book that the politics really play no role whatsoever in the actual story. Highly recommended- one of the best of the year.",5

For a book that borderline bashes the idea of capitalism it's a bit hypocritical.The other issue is that there are very few likable characters, including the main protagonist who does some pretty awful things, and Mr. Iles finds some pretty flimsy ways to justify them.The plot is well constructed and keeps you turning pages, but there were times when I felt like I was reading the screenplay to 'Threes Company: The Movie!""

It's a tour de force that still scares the bejezus out of everyone who reads it.The Torrance family are trapped in The Overlook Hotel for winter. For most of us that would mean long boring periods of watching movies on cable TV. For them, it's hell.Danny has a psychic power which somehow increases the intrinsic evil of the hotel itself. And caught between them is his father, Jack.As an unsuccessful alcoholic writer, Jack is like a self-portrait of an alternative version of the author himself (and I was astounded to read in his much later book On Writing that King himself claims he did not realize this until many years later). As the weakest of the three, he's the one the hotel takes over.And much of the power of this is that Jack is at heart a good man. Weak, but good. He took the job to help his family, to try to keep himself away from booze and solve his anger management issues. That he's trapped and subverted by an evil hotel is a tragedy.So this novel has both irony and compassion for all three members of the family.Within ten years King would go over to the side of political correctness. If he wrote this novel today, Jack would have no humanity or redeeming qualities. His wife would kill him to protect Danny and we'd wonder why they ever got married to begin with.",5

Trump was mentioned less than 8 times and never in the context of bashing or taking a political stance. The story line was gripping with one plausible crises after another. Just when you thought near the end, there could not be another crises, think again. Sure there were unlikable characters, but there was a close balance of likable characters you may want to see in another Iles book.

That's what I said when I finished Directorate S. It's a doorstop of a book.

To be fair, the author, Steve Coll, is a top-notch journalist, who covered South Asia for decades. He has worked for publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker. He understands the culture (and foibles) of powerful Americans, and he has a great feel for bureaucratic inanity. But Directorate S isn't really a history of the war in Afghanistan. Instead, it's a mountainous mishmash of recycled journalism. Some of it is superbly reported. Some of it is ephemeral trivia. But all of it leans heavily on storytelling dervices such as vignettes, anecdotes, reconstructed conversations, and the stories of individuals (usually high officials). The narrative often blurs as the reporting jumps back and forth between the CIA, ISAF, the White House, the State Department, Karzai's presidency, and Pakistan's ISI. Insider political gossip abounds: Obama disliked Richard Holbrooke; Zal Khalizad was an operator glued to his cellphone; Karzai saw conspiracies everywhere; ISI directors are chainsmokers; CIA contractors are scum; Benazir Bhutto was a drama queen, and so forth.

Material like this gets old after 300 pages or so, espcially when the reader's expectations have been raised by the heft of the book. Incredibly, Afghanistan itself gets left out of the story. Directorate S has little to say about Afghan politics, village culture, tribal networks, government institutions, or economy (except for opium production). Likewise, the U.S. ground war gets short shrift (one chapter), though CIA counter-terrorism operations are well-covered. Also barely mentioned is the huge (and frequently unsuccessful) international effort to build Afghanistan's institutions and economy, no doubt because USAID and the World Bank aren't as sexy as the CIA, even though they are vastly more consequential, especially when they fail. What ambitious reporter wants to cover USAID?

I enjoyed Directorate S because I worked in Kabul and have first-hand knowledge of a few of the people and events discussed in the book. Everything in it rings true, especially the picture of U.S. policy as perpetually adrift, distracted, and unsure of how to manage Afghanistan at an acceptable cost. In the end, however, Directorate S is a long slog through Coll's years of reporting on bits and pieces of the war, culled from sources willing to be interviewed. (He apparently had greater access to the Obama White House than the Bush White House.) Alas, doing the job of journalism -- even great journalism -- doesn't always lead a reporter to the material needed needs for a comprehensive and well-documented work of history or political science. Directorate S isn't such a work.",5

"328","Exceptional You!: 7 Ways to Live Encouraged, Empowered, and Intentional","One of my favorites...","Orsayor Simmons","1546010629","R1E03NY04W20CQ","1555065313","Exceptional You by Victoria Osteen is easily one of my favorite books of 2019. I love reading inspirational books, but this one resonated with me from beginning to end. Maybe it's because of the things I have been experiencing in my life lately that made me hold on tightly to Victoria's words of encouragement. The title implies that there are seven ways to live encouraged, empowered, and intentional, but I feel as though Victoria gives the readers more than seven ways to live your best life.

The reason I feel as though she gives more than seven ways is each of the seven core principles is broken down with two main points. Let me not forget about the Exceptional Thoughts section!! The Exceptional Thoughts section opens up discussion amongst each other or yourself. I would recommend getting yourself a journal and write out how you can apply these principles to your life.

Victoria Osteen also shares stories of people who are now living their exceptional life. That's one of the things I love about Victoria; she has the gift of storytelling. One of the stories she shared was a story of her friend that owns IT Cosmetics. It's always a fantastic thing to hear about the backstory of someone's success. It serves as a reminder that things don't ever happen overnight. We have to be persistent, faithful, and never give up on our dreams! God may not come when we want him to, but HE is still on time.

I also recommend that everyone get themselves a Memory Box and hold on close to it. You will have to read the book to find out what I'm referring to, but I believe it's one of the most powerful thing you can do for yourself.

I highly recommend you buy this book for yourself! It's time for us to start embracing what makes us Exceptional!!",5

The lessons Dave learned from Lucy aren’t going to surprise anyone. The author himself admits that these are obvious, common sense lessons we all know already. But as he says, we often do a lousy job of using what we know. If reading this encourages you to implement some of these lessons more consistently, I’m sure you will start to feel happier.

This is even somewhat educational. I will never look at scallops the same again!

I highly recommend this book to anyone with a heart and a sense of humor.

I rarely give 5 stars to a book and frankly the amount of trash that I have read over the past two years in this genre thrillers, detective stories this was gold to my mind. When do you ever find literature in a modern day thriller, murder story. There were many phrases that I found myself reading again simply because they were literature at it's best. Even more interesting were the characters and the development throughout the story. Apart from perhaps Girl On The Train, the vast majority are utterly boring either weak pathetic characters or Amazon women, that have no relation to anyone that thankfully you will ever meet. Yes I can see some readers points regarding the pretty obvious twists, especially if you enjoy this section of fiction. However, did it matter, did it truly spoil the story itself. Certainly there was enough action and I can forgive that simply because the writing and the actual fact that this was so very different to the 'run of the mill' books on the market today'. As for the black and white films, wasn't this also part of the story, for sure am older than many of you as I do remember many of them and frankly like many modern films, especially this years Oscars were far more exciting and better acted.

"391","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","A Mentally Ill Woman, Anna Fox, Witnesses Her Neighbor's Murder; Unfortunately, No One Believes Her!","J. B. Hoyos","62678426","R2XFFBB9ESDL1J","1555069833","Dr. Anna Fox, a child psychologist, lives alone in a five-story brownstone in Harlem. Suffering from agoraphobia, she is trapped inside the mansion, unable to leave. She spends most of her day playing chess, giving medical advice in a computer chat room, watching classic black-and-white films, drinking wine, taking medications, and spying on her neighbors with her Nikon D5500 camera. One evening, she witnesses the murder of one of her neighbors and calls the police. Unfortunately, no one believes her; everyone thinks she's delusional. Soon afterwards, someone begins breaking into her home at night and terrorizing her.A. J. Finn's ""The Woman in the Window"" is a tense, psychological thriller that is very disturbing. I actually lost sleep after reading this one. My heart broke for Dr. Anna Fox's plight. She is separated from her husband, Ed, and her eight-year-old daughter, Olivia. Her only associates are her physical therapist, Bina, and her psychiatrist, Dr. Julian Fielding, who keeps reminding her not to mix drugs and alcohol. However, Anna continues swallowing anti-depressants as though they are candy and guzzling bottles of wine. The combination produces hallucinations. It is not surprising that no one believes she witnessed a murder. Slowly, I began to wonder myself if she was hallucinating.I've always said that if you lose control of your life, someone else will gladly take control of it for you. However, you may not like what they do. Because of substance abuse, which has become a growing epidemic in our country, Anna loses control of her life. This also happens to Rachel Watson, an alcoholic, in ""The Girl on the Train,"" the internationally best-selling novel from Paula Hawkins. I can understand why many readers are comparing ""The Woman in the Window"" to ""The Girl on the Train.""While reading ""The Woman in the Window,"" I kept asking myself, ""Why is Anna spying on her neighbors?"" This isn't the type of behavior a professional should engage in. I could only surmise she is living her life vicariously through her neighbors. Her life has been put on hold because of the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which led to her agoraphobia. For the longest time, I kept asking myself, ""What traumatic event did Anna endure that led to the PTSD and the subsequent agoraphobia?"" What horrible incident made her seek safety and shelter in her huge, lonely brownstone? Her only contact with the outside world is through a computer chat room where she converses with strangers who suffer from a similar illness as her own.While Anna is dishing out medical advice to strangers, I kept repeating an old proverb: ""Physician, heal thyself."" Yes, I was very saddened by Anna's plot; however, at the same time, I was also very agitated, frustrated, angry, and frightened. I knew she was steadily losing control of her life and setting herself up for a very bad fall. Indeed, the fall comes when she thinks she witnesses the murder of one of the neighbors across the park. (There is a narrow strip of land with a walking path and a few benches and light posts that separate two rows of brownstones facing each other.) When the investigating detectives see the bottles of wine and pills littering her coffee table, they automatically assume she is delusional.Finn's ""The Woman in the Window"" is a superb psychological thriller. It is not a high body count slasher, it is not a shoot-'em-up crime drama, and it is not a humorous, romantic cozy. It contains a mystery that is gritty and disturbing. I'll never look at a wine bottle or a vial of pills again in the same way. I will seek solace through other means besides alcohol and drugs, prescribed or otherwise. Some readers may describe the novel's first one-hundred pages as ""slow-paced"" but I found it fascinating to learn about Anna's life as a recluse. For example, most everything she needed, such as groceries, she would have delivered to her home.Anna Fox reminded me of Sandra Bullock's character, Angela Bennett, in the popular cult film ""The Net."" Angela is a reclusive software engineer who works and lives on her home computer system and seldom ventures outside. Everything she needs and wants is on the computer's internet. Like Anna, most of Angela's friends are anonymous people she meets in a chat room. She is targeted for death when she discovers something on a floppy disc she was never meant to see. Becoming lost and consumed by the World Wide Web is a theme that has been reoccurring for several decades now. Angela set herself up for disaster by refusing to interact with flesh-and-blood people, such as her neighbors.I was surprised to learn from reading the dust jacket that ""The Woman in the Window"" has already been translated into many languages around the world and is slated to become a major motion picture. It is A. J. Finn's debut novel. I've looked at his photograph on his bio page on Amazon; he appears to be very young for someone who has worked in the publishing industry with so many best-selling authors. Now I understand the accolades from popular ones such as Stephen King, Ruth Ware, Gillian Flynn, and Louise Penny. Is Finn's novel worth the publisher's hype? I've read better novels that received less attention. Nevertheless, if readers exercise a little patience, they will enjoy some worthwhile shocks and surprises from ""The Woman in the Window.""",4

"425","Daisy Jones & The Six: A Novel","Beautifully written tale of love, friendship and rock and roll","Kimberly Giffin","1524798622","R27IQS5KD8K5R1","1555085088","When I found out Taylor Jenkins Reid’s newest novel was inspired by Fleetwood Mac, I was so excited. I love Fleetwood Mac. A lot! A story of rock and roll in the 1970s full of larger than life characters and their drama. Yes, please! Sign me up! I was initially disappointed in the interview format of the book. It was hard for me to get into. Without a typical descriptive narrative, I had a hard time picturing the characters and their world. But the story had me hooked, so I kept reading. And I’m so glad I did. By the time I was about a third of the way through the book, I was enjoying the oral interview format of the book. It was playing out in my mind like an episode of VH1’s “Behind the Music”. Since individuals experience the same events differently, and memory can be a tricksy beast, I really enjoyed the differences in the band members’ recollections and how perception and misunderstandings shaped the band members’ relationships with each other. And then that subtle little twist at the end had me close to tears. DAISY JONES AND THE SIX is a story about music, love and friendship and the pressures and joys that come with them. But more than that it’s a story about the choices we make, the things we do and don’t do, the things we say and don’t say and how the intersection of those words and actions shapes not only our lives, but the lives of the people we love. And wouldn’t it be amazing if someone could record “Aurora”. I would love to listen to that. DAISY JONES AND THE SIX is a 4.5 out of 5 <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+009F> for me.

Sometime in the future, our progeny will look back at this time in history with awe at what we went through to recapture America from the evil forces that tried to bring back serfdom to the masses. If you don't think government officials in America can be evil and corrupt, you are living in a fantasy land.Look to France, Venezuela, the U.K., all around the world. Look at what socialist policies, promoted as ""social justice"" and ""progressivism"" have done to destroy the middle class and pool the wealth of the world for the evil elites. The main stream media simply will not tell you about the massive protests and revolutions going on in countries that have taken away the rights of the people and imposed so many taxes that people have difficulty buying food and just surviving. That's because the main stream media has been bought and paid for by the very same evil elites who want you fooled and docile. That is why we need heroes like the anonymous authors of this book to shine light in the darkness. And that is why you need to wake up to reality.Don't let them steal your children's future. Don't let them make slaves of us. Wake up, see the truth, and join the fight to take America back.

Knowing beauty, influence, fame, and privilege to be borrowed rather than bestowed, they are not easily impressed. They are not quick to envy or take offense.

Jordan has a new stepmother but there's something very wrong with Annaliese.  Seriously.  Nina- Nina is one of the best characters I've read in a long time.  She's a rip roaring Soviet pilot who is out for the Huntress- and she's married to Ian, who rescued her from her sickbed in Poland.  How these come together makes for a fascinating story. Well plotted with characters you can feel, this is so worth your time.  My only quibble- and I must point this out because whoever edited this otherwise perfect book should have caught it- is that Jordan is served a slice of German chocolate cake at her father's funeral in 1950.

Williams","0062678426","R31PCXB11N0D3M","1555089271","The biggest disappointment for me in this psychological thriller was the unconvincing portrayal of the heroine, Dr. Anna Fox. The author is a male, but he chooses to tells this story through his main character who is a woman. Only thing is, nothing about her portrayal as a female is at all female to me. Nothing rings true, not even a little bit. Nothing maternal,where maternal is called for, nothing sexy about her in any detail of the plot where such would be expected, nothing soft, simply bogus. Even her appearance is somehow out of sync with what we know. She is 30-something, but in every description I’m seeing a septuagenarian, or older. Very weird choices have been made by the author . Also, his overdosing us with her alcohol and drug habit is cloying. Enough already! I get it; she uses substance to get through having been traumatized by events, but at the rate we witness her imbibing and drugging, she would not even be able to notice anything from her windows, were she even able to remain conscious enough to see out of them, and yet, the author asks us to suspend our logic as he wants us to believe him as much as she wants to convince the police that she saw what she saw. All too tedious and really got hideously in the way of what could have been a pretty good read. I just did not like this book. No literary merit here that I could find. This plot is pretty conventional, so at the end of the day, to be outstanding, an author would have to really work on character development and details presented in a fresh and lyrical way,",5

""The Shining"" remains one of the most frightening of King's books, and accomplishes something that the King novels of today are incapable of doing:  presenting intricately flawed characters in less than 1,000 pages.  The characters of Jack & Danny, and Jack's influence of Danny's development into an adult (which one reads about in ""Dr. Sleep"") are nothing short of brilliant.

This book got me to go deeper. Free to focus was easy to understand but went one step further than other books, since it comes with links to resources-exercises you do after each section that have you apply what you’re learning to your own life.

I think this is what sets this book apart. It’s easy to read about cutting things from your list, it’s another to actually list out your tasks and do it. I also learned about things I thought I knew how to do, like delegation ... now I realize that I don’t do this as effectively or as intentionally as I could.

This book also acknowledges the importance of self-care in recharging so there's energy for productivity. Rather than the more, more, more burnout philosophy of other productivity systems.

All the stars to Taylor Jenkins Reid! Everything about this book was a pure delight. I absolutely loved the format! The book is told as a series of interviews with Daisy Jones, a singer and songwriter, as well as with the members of The Six, a seventies rock band. Also included are interviews with their closed friends, managers, wives, journalists and significant others. I was riveted!Daisy was a lost soul when she met up with the members of The Six but yet she was always a brilliant songwriter and singer in her own right. There is a huge clash of egos when she is asked to join the band and this inside look at this fictional band is how I always imagined real-life bands behaving. Daisy is both strong and fragile, and brilliant but terribly insecure.""I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else’s muse. I am not a muse. I am the somebody. End of ... story.""I was transported back to my teen years listening to seventies rock & roll while reading this book. The story evoked feelings of longing, loss and the rush of hearing a really great song for the first time. The book focuses on the meteoric rise of The Six and what it took in the seventies to make it big. The importance of magazines like 'Rolling Stone' and radio airplay seems irrelevant now but that is what made rock musicians superstars years ago. And the non-stop partying is not shied away from here. It's a wonder anyone ever made it out alive.“I can’t think of any two things that make you quite as self-absorbed as addiction and heartbreak. I had a selfish heart. I didn’t care about anyone or anything but my own pain. My own need. My own aching. I’d have made anyone hurt if it could have taken some of mine away. It’s just how sick I was.”I also was enthralled by the book's three very strong female protagonists. Daisy, Karen and Camila each had their own way of coping with fame, addiction, love and heartbreak. They all felt VERY real to me and I felt like I was reading a non-fiction biography of a favorite rock band. But the main focus of the book was the relationship between Daisy and Billy, the lead singer and songwriter for of The Six. Their chemistry was volatile and they both brought out the best and the worst in each other. Yet the music they made together was pure magic.""You know how sometimes people will describe other people and say they make you feel like you’re the only one in the room? Billy and Daisy could both do that. But they somehow did it with each other. They each seemed like they thought the other one was the only person in the room. Like we were watching two people who didn’t realize thousands of people were watching them.""This book is creative, surprising, heartbreaking and uplifting. I can't recommend it highly enough! Of course there was a stunning twist that I never saw coming. I still have a book hangover a week after finishing and I can't stop thinking and Daisy, Bill and The Six. This is also the rare book that I have read and also plan to listen to on audio. Don't miss this book! 5+++++ stars.“Oh, honey, I can wait/To call that home/I can wait for the blooms and the honeycomb.”",5

They savor the terse and virile writers like Conrad and James Dickey, even Louis L’Amour, and they share Hemingway’s ardor for fishing. One summer break, they decide to rough it in the Northern Canadian wilderness and take a month-long river canoe trip. They are experienced in all things wilderness, and are well-prepped for the journey (except for not taking a sat phone for safety—the only incredulous decision-making in the novel). Off they go for the outdoor expedition of their lives!Jack has a past of great loss that he still hasn’t resolved, possesses a bit of a glass half empty philosophy, and is quick and instinctive in judgment. Wynn is more studied and spiritual, more glass half full in his outlook. They complement each other, and take pride in their acumen with all things river, canoe, and wilderness. Heller, who is also a Dartmouth grad and has kayaked all over the world, must have a trace of Jack and Wynn within him. And, like his previous novel, THE PAINTER, he seamlessly intersects nature and art, so that the landscape, in his frequently anthropomorphic, metaphorical descriptions, is a character in itself.“The implacability and violence of nature always awed him. That it could be entirely heedless and yet so beautiful…But also its intricate intelligence. Its balancings. Its quiet compensations. It was like some unnamed justice permeated everything.”The story kicks off quickly and the challenges they face will test their better angels vs. their demons. Nature and man commingle and combust in equal measure, and the pages turn heatedly as you journey to the end of the river with the two young men. Is this river trip truly heaven on earth, or will it be a hellish grave? The twists, turns, perils, and eternal poetry of the wilderness are reflected in Heller’s prose. I was breathless when I came to the end.",5

"633","Someone Knows","A huge disappointment from a favorite author--everything else by her is better than this...","J.K","0525539646","RU27TAQ7XKHY2","1555250479","It literally pains me to write this negative review of Someone Knows by one of my top three authors, Lisa Scottoline.

Teenagers Sasha, Julian, David, and Allie find a gun buried in the ground. Nothing good can come of that. When another teenager is shot dead playing Russian roulette, guilt changes all their lives forever.

The author’s writing quality is spot-on as usual. However, the first half of the book is set twenty years before the present and reads like a young adult book. Sasha is an unrepentant Mean Girl—only her needs matter. Julian is in love with Sasha mostly from afar thanks to his “hobby” of peeping into windows. Allie is a conflicted chubby good girl broken by her sister’s recent death and mother’s emotional breakdown. David is being forced to be a star tennis player by his father regardless of his own desires. All are teenage stereotypes with little else distinguishing them.

I forced myself to read the first half in the hopes of a great twisty conclusion. I was disappointed unfortunately. The denouement’s big surprise is completely unbelievable. In my opinion, Someone Knows was a failure from start to finish. Please read any other book by this author rather than this one. You will be glad you did. I’m giving this mess 2 stars because the writing, grammar and spelling are first rate. But the plot...the plot.

"652","Pet Sematary: A Novel","The Dead should stay dead- a quick and fun read","Baranabus","198211598X","R9ZJ0UX3MZQNX","1555251996","I have to hand it to King- there's a reason this guy sells billions of books. He can really tell a story, flesh it out and pace it very well. He's also great at creating a believable, ordinary setting and then infusing the supernatural in a fairly believable way. Like others, I found the beginning of the book a bit too slow of a buildup; it could've been tightened up quite a bit. However this is probably the fastest I've ever read a long book. So the flow is generally very effective.I don't want to spoil too much, but it's hard to describe without doing that.  Sometimes his zombie thing works and sometimes it doesn't. It's most effective when describing his cat. I would say the highlight was the old man Jud's tale of Timmy Baterman; that was truly effective and eerie. By the final climax, it's predictable and off-and-on effective. He's most effective when he's using small details to set an ominous tone. The climax is over the top; it might have been more effective if the son had just been an eerie zombie and not a murderous one. Like others said, it almost becomes a ""Chucky bloodbath"".His use of pop culture references is effective, if over used. He's used that device before and generally it somehow grounds the atmosphere of supernatural into an everyday setting which is what King excels at. Also, he refers to death as ""Oz, the Great and Terrible"", based on a child's view of Death as a force. It's overused, but very effective; it fits in with his meditation on death as an ever-present unavoidable danger that we all fight but ultimately surrender to. This is a tale of not accepting death; someone said he could've put more profound thoughts into this but I think he does a pretty good job for a popular novel. I don't expect serious existentiality in a horror tale; he makes his points in a believable way through the eyes of his characters. One of his strong points is in illustrating a character's inner thoughts to really show the true horror. He's much better at this than a typical bloodbath ending.Speaking of characters, his two most effective are Jud the old man (even if it seems cliche of Wise Country Old Timer, it works) and the undead cat. They set the tone of dread and demonstrate compelling force that lurks in the Indian burial ground. I also liked his invocation of the classic monster, the Wendigo, even if its purpose was a little vague. He could've elaborated more on why it was there. There are some vague allusions to cannibalism that don't quite fit, even though he talks about cannibalizing one's grief and sanity. I guess it works but...Like others, I thought the scene of the funeral fight was over the top and unnecesary and lent an unintended slapstick to an otherwise serious story in which death was an everpresent malevolent force.King and some of his readers have said this was his scariest book; i haven't read much King so I can't say, but The Stand was much better at creating a very creepy tone of dread. Also, apparently he did this fairly early in his career-he shelved it for a long while- so it does showcase his talent pretty well. His pacing is impeccable and his skills for creating tension are tight. The grave digging and night scenes are pretty brilliant, as his wife and Jud's futile efforts to stop a morbid escapade.I also enjoyed the historical devices of Jud's tales of setting the history of the burial ground; it's such a cliche to say ""Indian burial ground' in horror. So it helps to create a believable back story there. He actually gets away with using a well-worn device.Overall, it has very strong points and a somewhat predictable and disappointing end. As I said before, I would've preferred less of a blood bath and more of an eerie zombie ending. His creation of eerie zombies (as opposed to the brain-eating, Night of the LIving Dead kind) was very effective and chilling. It felt much more real than the movie stereotype.",4

From page 1, this book is immediately directed toward women, which I initially sorta balked at and felt like I was being given a good-intention, high-volume, New Age talking-to. Written by identical twin sisters (who offer frequent pop culture references, real-talk asides, and emphatically describe things to a reader, as if highlighting concepts with wiggly jazz hands), they define burnout as a mix of prolonged emotional labor, caregiver fatigue, and feeling as though your efforts are not noticed or rewarded. They advise their readers to confront and respond to stressors in a full circle, complete-the-process sorta way, finding what works for you and self-care that works, addressing debilitating self-talk, charting the plus and minuses of a decision that needs to be made, being comfortable with who you are and how you look, shrugging off expectation and nearly unreal societal standards, and seeking & maintaining meaningful connections with others - all with a heavy hand in narrative therapy tactics.",5

"697","Top 10 Games You Can Play In Your Head, By Yourself: Second Edition","Please give this book a chance and have an open mind - it's amazing!!!","Andrew","998379417","R2C1XXJDSVHZKA","1555254811","Little premise: I love Sherlock Holmes and the Mind Palace technique, and the way it's portrayed in various media. I've made my Mind Palace into an extended Sanctuary similar to the beginning of this book, so it was easier for me to jump into the stories. For the uninitiated, a mind palace is basically a mental building or set of rooms and places where you can mentally walk through them, and place objects or memory triggers in order to remember information. I've been using this technique for everything from studying to learning new skills to memorizing grocery lists and names of people I meet.From the first exercise alone, I was able to clearly envision the game and play against myself easily, and no joke: it's legit fun. Being able to play these kinds of games, once I have the rules and structures down, is really really fun, and I really enjoyed it all the way to the end of the book. Having the rules in place gave me clear direction about where to go, and then it sets me loose to create all sorts of fun.I've got a few original characters that I've slotted into the protagonist or antagonist positions in the games, and I've made it so that my personal self was more of the game master than anything else, moving around characters like chess pieces and watching some fun interactions play out. It's literally inspiring me to create a sort of storytime animation based off my games, so hopefully, that'll come to fruition eventually.I'll give an example based off the Egypt tomb experience:My protagonist is an OC named Serenity, and she's a museum curator who is hoping to preserve some ancient relics from a forbidden tomb. Her antagonist is a child spirit of chaos named ""Aggression"" and she's sort of the poltergeist of the tomb, setting off traps and leading people astray.My own game master character and my Shadow self created the labyrinth: myself creating the walls and rooms and the Shadow creating the traps and creatures. I already had a magic system in place for my characters, so being able toWe get pretty 4th-wall breaking, as in my own Mind Palace they're just playing the game, but it leads into a bigger story where the Shadow takes control of the game from me, and Serenity is solving puzzles and battling the undead....and that's where I'll leave off from there. I guess it also helps that I love world-building and the whole D&D creation aspect of everything really appeals to me.To those who didn't like the book, I strongly urge you to give it another chance, read through the rules and structures several times and work with them, and take the time and effort to craft your world in your head. It takes effort, yes, this is not just something you pick up and play immediately, but once the foundation is set, your games will be so immersive that it almost becomes second nature to you. Practice until something clicks, and try something different if you think that something doesn't work for you. This is your brain, and the book provides the guidelines for you to create your game world.100/10 book, would love to see you release another edition with some more of the games that weren't included, or at the very least I'd love to see you create a Corridor video with a full story and script that you write based off one of the games in this book.~ spywi's mind palace",5

"710","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Best book I've ever read (and I don't read many books).","683","198211598X","R34YBZYEF5WMG","1555255827","Ever since I've seen Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film version of ""The Shining"", I really wanted to read the book, but never got to it, and when I did, it was hard putting it down. It's 500 pages worth of emotion, terror, and great suspense. After reading the book, I compared it to the movie. There are certain things that are better in the book and better in the movie. The book hits the emotional level better since it talks about the struggles in the Torrance family. It delves into all of their lives more and you really feel for all of the characters. When they get to the hotel, they all seem happy, and that's when I really didn't want all of that bad stuff to happen, so when it happens, it's extremely suspenseful. The film version doesn't delve into the emotional factor enough. There also many different cool things that aren't it the movie, like the scrapbook of the history of the hotel, the wasps, their trips to Sidewinder, and the topiary animals (but I'm glad they didn't have the animals in the film). There are a lot of entertaining things in the book that aren't present in the film. The thing that's better in the film is the way they upgraded the terror. In one of the pivotal scenes in the book, when Jack appears behind Wendy and she hits him on the head with a wine bottle, they definitely made it more intense in the film, where instead she finds hundreds of papers with the line ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" and Jack creeps up behind her, where he follows Wendy up the stairs and she hits him on the head with a baseball bat, in a scene that lasts 10 minutes. It's by far my favorite scene in the movie and I was a little disappointed that it wasn't like that in the book, but there was a great build-up of suspense before that part in the book.The endings were different, and I don't know which one I liked better, but I can conclude I enjoyed the book probably just as much as the film. Even though the 1997 Mick Garris version probably sucks, I still am gonna see it soon. Altogether, this book was pure enjoyment from beginning to end. It's heartwarming, sad, suspenseful, and even though I knew what was going to happen, I was terrified. Stephen King wrote this book so uniquely and it's definitely the best book I've ever read!",5

Not great but still pretty good. All the characters had different voices, and when Jack Torrance gets angry the narrator really gives a great performance. I would say the production quality of this story was very good.Now the story is great, it's about a haunted hotel. A hotel with a very shady past and the ghosts seem to stick around. The hotel only really comes alive in the winter, on the anniversary of an old party that occurred many years ago that replays every year it seems. So during the summer months when this Colorado hotel is open everything seems normal, but when the hotel closes down for the winter that's when the hotel starts to get restless.In comes Jack Torrance and his family, and Jack really needs a job after getting fired from his teaching job after he got angry with a student. So the family moves to Colorado and the Overlook Hotel for the winter because of the money, and during this time Jack plans on finishing writing a play. Because of Jack's past anger problems he's a ripe vessel for the hotel to prey on.And what the Hotel wants is his son, Danny. Danny has The Shining, a special ability that allows him to read thoughts of others and even speak to others who have the shining. And because of this power the hotel wants to absorb it and gain more power.This is one of King's better stories, and it ends well, which can sometimes be a problem with King. This is an easily recommended story by King in fact it's one of the books to recommend for a new reader to King. And lastly, the book is way different than the Stanley Kubrick movie, so don't presume that you know what's happening because you watched that movie - you don't.",5

In the end, we too are ready to roll over and expire... but, as we are lead to believe, this is an individual with a lot more to share and many years left to spread his unmistakable inner delight that we, as readers, have come to understand as a distinctive quality of Less, who is really More.",5

Pet Sematary might be the scariest book I've ever read because it is a believable horror story with excellent character development and invokes serious sympathy for the novel's main character, Louis Creed, who has just moved his family from Chicago to Ludlow, Maine, and takes a job at the university health center as the main doctor.Louis Creed, his wife Rachel, and his two kids, Ellie and Gage, along with Church, Ellie's beloved cat, realize this new home in Maine is the beginning of a new life.  They meet Jud, the neighbor across the ""road"", and he and Louis become pretty good friends and share many beers together.  One day Ellie notices a trail by their house that leads to what Jud calls the ""Pet Semetary,"" a place where kids have buried their pets who have been killed (usually by getting hit by a huge truck on the ""road"").Then while Rachel, Gage, and Ellie are visiting her parents, a trip that Louis does not make because of his disdain for Rachel's father, Church gets hit by a truck and Jud suggests they bury the cat before Ellie returns.  Except instead of burying him in the Pet Sematary, Jud introduces Louis to the Micmac burial grounds that is beyond the Pet Sematary, where they proceed to bury Church.But Church comes back, showing up a few days later to Louis' horror.  The cat appears the same, but is somehow different and smells like he just came from a grave.  However, Ellie comes back from Chicago and is really happy to see Church alive even though he really is different and smells really bad.A short time later tragedy strikes again when Gage is killed by a truck on the road and Louis decides to try burying him also in the Micmac burial grounds, whose ground is sacred and Jud has warned that people no matter what circumstance should never be buried there.  However, Louis is grief struck and ignores Jud's pleas and proceeds to bury Gage.  When Gage comes back, he is also different, and is no longer the same ""Gage"" but an evil three year old who wants nothing better than revenge.This book had me reading into the wee hours of the night and I honestly had to sleep with a night light on for a full six months after reading this book.  The movie, by the way, did the novel absolutely no justice.  The book is way better and significantly scarier.  If you like scary stories that are original and will stand the test of time, Pet Sematary is a great book.",5

Kelley","162860378X","R3MAHZZRT2B13H","1555258986","If this book is a starting point to encourage further research then this book serves its purpose.  As mentioned, Dr. Berry, offers no footnotes or links to research his information.  So do not take any of his claims as final truth.  If you research you will find contradicting studies and opinions all over that will likely lead you to throw your hands up in the air and get on with your life as usual.With that said, there are a few grammatical errors in this book, some explanations that seem a bit confusing or contradictory.  Although not really important, I agree with some of his positions because I have read some of the books he has mentioned and at length researched the info.Since I tend to be fairly balanced in my eating habits and don’t go to excess like consuming gallons of milk per week or eating a loaf of whole wheat bread every day or two then I’m not too concerned with what he has said about those products.  In my mind, research has yet to unequivocally resolve the milk/grain issue.  You’ll find contradicting info on this.  Weight has never been a problem for me like apparently it has been for Dr. Berry.  I don’t drink a lot of milk and I couldn’t care less that it’s not a good source of vitamin D any more than nutritional value of tea which I drink occasionally or beer for that matter.I enjoy my meat and am not afraid of saturated fats.  I agree with Dr. Berry’s position on this.  Cholesterol, well, that’s another story.  Few years ago I stopped taking my statins because of what I read in The Great Cholesterol Myth.  Now I have hypercholesterolemia, at least, the numbers indicate that.  Cholesterol is just one of many players in the atherosclerotic process, so, I wouldn’t throw it out with the bath water just yet.  This doctor and several others think they know the truth.  Do your research on this one and you’ll find maybe they are correct or maybe they aren’t.Anyway, I could continue but enough said for now.  Oh yeah, one other topic and that’s sun and skin cancer.  Again, with research I’m not totally convinced that there is NOT a link.  Some studies appear to show a correlation between UV rays and basal/squamous cell cancers and perhaps much less connection with melanomas.  Opposed to what Dr. Berry wrote there seems to be more of BC and SC cancers in sun exposed parts of the body than what he implied.",3

It was full of the usual hijinks with a baddie and plenty of mayhem.

Co-written by his son, Dirk Cussler, Clive is increasingly letting his legacy off to others. While I’m glad the series continues, there are some issues.

The biggest weak spot for me was the writing mechanics. While I had a great time and the story still contained all the trademarks I’ve loved since the beginning, this time, the point of view was more of an issue that usual. While Clive has always written in solid third-person, past-tense, he’s also been a bit loose with control of his characters. He’s head-hopped a bit, but not to the point where it was too jarring, at least that I can recall, since I learned to tell the difference.

In Celtic Empire, especially in the latter half of the book, there were several places where the point of view shifts without warning, and it was jarring. I had to stop reading, back up and go “what???” Then I figured out he was writing in another character’s head.

That head-hopping is one of my pet peeves and I was quite disappointed to see it so flagrant in this story. It was the one thing that detracted from an otherwise fun read.

I was still able to close the book with the usual smile on my face, but not without wondering what’s going to happen in future installments if things keep going this way.",5

By recognizing the harm caused by sticking with the standard of care even when the best designed studies show such care doesn’t work or worse is damaging to patients, doctors lose all credibility and the chance to help patients heal.  Sometimes their treatments in fact kill patients.The medical myths show several examples of harm from a system that fails to challenge its own dogmas even when good evidence shows those dogmas are wrong.  Also, we patients now have access to a wealth of medical knowledge via the internet and we see that often doctor doesn’t know best.  Patients need to persist in sharing knowledge with doctors both to bring our own treatment into the light and to hopefully become a team member with our doctors to return us to health.  If your doctor will not work with you fire him or her and find  a new one!I believe we are living through the dark ages of big pharma controlled medical education and that this cannot continue  much longer as the truth escapes and reveals the fallacy of a sick care rather than a health care based system.  Why are doctors still not trained in nutrition or the success of high dose vitamin C in stopping major infections or cancer or building strong immune systems?  This book shines a light on the need for all of us to stand up for change.",5

Only after several chapters did it become clear to me that he's only dismissing exercise specifically for weight loss (he acknowledges the importance of exercise for other aspects of health) AND that he apparently makes a distinction between exercise that occurs in a gym and other forms of physical activity.  Yes, it is true that ""exercise"" in and of itself won't necessarily make you lose weight, but most people who are seeking to lose weight want to look better (not just weigh less) and exercise does contribute substantially to that goal.  It's also important to understand that doing some sorts of physical activity you enjoy gives you the same benefits that formal exercise in a gym setting does and the author is not recommending that you be sedentary.  While the clarifications later in the book are helpful, someone who quits reading after the first few chapters will likely be left with a very mistaken impression that exercise isn't important to health - and nothing could be further from the truth!Other than the exercise issue, I found the book to be full of practical health information that anyone can use - and can help them avoid the problems that can result from well-intended, but misguided, medical misinformation.",4

I loved the unrolling of the plot, so skillfully crafted with well-researched historical facts, and then, topped off with a very memorable main character that is written as the essence of intelligence, nuance and understatement.The story begins shortly after WWI, when the Bolsheviks have taken over the governance of the former Russian Empire.  An aristocrat is deemed a ""non-person"" and sentenced to the confines of Moscow's Metropol Hotel, rather than being stood against a wall and shot as a hated remnant of the privileged elite of last century Europe.  Without fuss or complaint, Count Rostov proudly removes himself and a few tokens of his family's past, from his suite of lavish hotel rooms, to a attic garrett, devoid of any hint of his past.  He makes do with his fate, believing that one must conquer one's situation, or else the situation will conquer him.As the months pass, the Count experiences many peaks and troughs of emotions and a deep sense of loss.  Then, quite by accident, Rostov befriends a half-grown, cheeky but intelligent girl who, along with her governess, is also trapped in the confines of the grand hotel, until another family member comes and takes her away to a new life, in the far reaches of the new state.  What the Count doesn't readily acknowledge is that little Nora becomes his savior, as she shows him how to double the size of his house arrest world, by giving him the master key to all the hidden hallways, cellars, storage rooms and passageways that only the hotel staff use.  Rostov soon masters his enlarged world, both physically and intellectually, and becomes one of the hotel staff, albeit still regarded by his colleagues as respected royalty.As the years and decades pass, Count Rostov accepts his fate and comes to enjoy his position as the head waiter and cuisine expert of the hotel.  His closest friends become the chef, the maitre'd and, later, Nina's  young daughter, Sophia, who is dropped off into the Count's care but remains with Rostov.  As time moves onward, the girl and the deposed aristocrat evolve into a small family with the other hotel staff as her beloved and attentive aunts and uncles.Sophia develops into a gifted pianist and wins prizes for her innate skill to bring much life to the works of the European master composers.  She wins a chance to perform in Paris, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the world outside of Moscow and the hotel, as well as a door to her future.  Knowing full well that the old aristocracy has been erased from his world forever, the Count uses his undiminished gifts of nuance and mastery of recognizing one's fate to change both Sophia's and his life forever.  It his greatest gamble in his long life and his master key to the future.Not only has the author captured a grand gentleman's life among the masses, Amor Towles uses captivating language and a myriads of plot developments to create a world special to old Moscow and those still caught between the past and the future of their nation.  True to the understated, elegant manner of the Count, the conclusion is masterfully under-stated and cleverly wrought.  I shall say no more.I can recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, superb language and a storyline that captivates and keeps the reader wanting more.",5

"932","The Right Side of History: How Reason and Moral Purpose Made the West Great","Intellectually honest Americans should consider Shapiro's thesis seriously.","WisconsinAlex","62857908","R1U57VUNDJJIT6","1555321764","Preliminary disclosure: my background is in academic ethics and mathematics. I'm Catholic, so I feel I don't have too much to say about the Judaic theological elements of this book. I read ancient Greek well enough to read the originally Greek parts of the Bible in its original language. My undergraduate thesis was about Aristotle's jurisprudential thought. After that, I'm fairly well-read in the various varieties of virtue ethics, both ancient and contemporary. This background is what informs my review.My review is not about the meritoriousness of his argument, but in a sense more about the rhetorical strategy Shapiro deploys. I do this because I think Shapiro has a defendable position which I think is wrong, but it's not obviously wrong. It's worthy of individual engagement and consideration, which I do not wish to taint for any reader.Review:Risking overstatement, Shapiro does a fairly good job at explaining a fairly nuanced thesis to a generalized audience. That said, I feel that this book will be non-dispositive to anybody who isn't inclined to agree with him. For example, in chapter 4, I was dismayed at the lack of engagment of the debates within Athenian thought about the nomos and logos. Chapter 4 especially seems to brush past fruitful nuance for the sake of making his argument seem almost tautologically self-evident. That lack of engagment might feel disingenuous, and therefore unworthy of meaningful consideration by Shapiro's interlocutors. Obviously, that dismissal on those grounds from a reader would be wrong-headed, but I think it's an important intellectual reality that isn't dealt with well. It makes Shapiro look like a Sophist and potentially unfairly maligns his position. Unfortunately, that non-nuanced sentiment seems to prevade the book more generally, excluding the introduction which I thought was well written. I know it's hard to condense several centuries of some of the world's best philosophical into a coherant ~200 pages, but I think Shapiro could have done a better job.The Right Side of History is de facto an important book because of it's massive audience. It needed to be readable for a global audience who is relatively ignorant of our intellectual roots/the discourse of which we are all a part. To that end, I commend Ben so much.Read this book if:1. You are a liberal arts-type person who might not currently take Shapiro seriously, but can entertain ideas without accepting them.2. You are interested in the loneliness epidemic in the West generally.Or3. You are concerned about the lack of engagement of classical ideas in contemporary society, but don't really know where to get started.Ending thoughts:I hope everyone who reads this book finds it as interesting as I did. I think the best way to do that is to honestly and genuinely step into Shapiro's world and allow yourself the liberty to think deeply about it. This does not mean accept it, unless it truly convinces you. I wrote this review on my phone while on a bus, sorry for the typos.",3

My first lesson when reading the book was that my goal wasn't to learn to work faster so I could add more work. No, it was about blending my purpose, passion, and priorities. I changed my WHY for being more productive.

When I'm free to focus, I can choose the best tasks and not only do them well, but be efficient so there is margin for other priorities in my life.

I especially like the charts and exercises in each chapter to help me sort it all out. I've already implemented some changes based on what I've learned about myself in the book.

I highly recommend the book to anyone who wants to evaluate and rearrange life goals and break them down into doable tasks while leaving room for meaningful extras.

My youngest child just started college this year, so my husband and I are empty nesters. I had a job that I loved and was fully committed to it. It fulfilled me and brought great joy, and then two years ago, I was fired. I spent quite a while wondering just what was going on and what I was going to do now. Fast forward to today, and I'm still working on that process.Girl, Stop Apologizing isn't what it appears on the surface. I started reading thinking it was going to be uplifting and encouraging me not to say ""I'm sorry"" so much and to have the self-esteem to own my choices. In a way, that's what this book is about, but it's really so much more.This is a book about peeling away the excuses and figuring out how to turn your dreams and goals into reality. Yes, her writing style is a bit loose, some parts are braggy and unnecessary, some of the things are out of my reach practically, and there's a bit of repetition from Girl, Wash Your Face: but there's so much to learn and embrace in this book. It's empowering and uplifting while also providing tools and ideas for propelling you forward into a more fulfilling and joyful existence.I finally feel like I can see the beginnings of new goals and new dreams for my future, and it's exciting to imagine!I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.",4

Scratch that, I almost didn't even make it past 10% of the book. My thoughts during those times? I thought everyone was over dramatic and overreacted over everything. Oh yeah, Hardin was an a*hole and not the endearing kind and Tessa was an obsessed little virgin. Let me explain, I felt like she thought about him every other sentence of the book. We get it, Hardin has tattoos, piercings, and is hot as h***. But when did that ever become an excuse to be a d***?So I still kind of think those things but guess what? I kept on reading and I couldn't stop. And more importantly, I didn't want to. Hardin would show me pieces of himself that made me care for him and Tessa grew trough the novel. I didn't think she was as naive anymore towards the end. Sitting in bed was ALL I wanted to do but I have a life I have to live...and kids that are too young to feed themselves.During the night when I would get my reading done, I would be talking to the characters, laughing at them, and cussing them out. Yes, I talk to my kindle. I would giggle like a school girl in the most inappropriate times. Is this really one direction fan fic?! To answer my own question, yes, yes it is. Thank god I didn't picture them while I was reading though. That's pretty much why I've put off reading it for so long.You guys have all read the synopsis so I won't waste your time with summarizing the book. All I know is that it was full of angst and borderline dysfunctional people. Like for real...it's not borderline, it's full on dysfunction. They spend most of the book getting mad and yelling over stupid s***. It wasn't just one either, both of them were very irrational but weirdly, that's what made me like them. I hate books that have overdramatize characters but I if its written well, I can handle it.It was very tough for me to put the book down. I'm glad I took the chance to read this. I'm already on book 2 and plan to get the rest. This is definitely my guilty pleasure read. If we're wondering if you should pick this up or not, I suggest you do. So what if one direction was behind the inspiration? Just picture your own characters and go into this with an open mind.",4

Much to her parents' dismay, she is now an addict, homeless and panhandles for money. Simon was always close to her daughter and will do anything to save her. He confronts Paige and Aaron one day and goes viral for attacking Aaron. Three months later, Aaron is dead, Paige is missing and Simon will do whatever it takes to find and save his daughter.
OK, so I confess, I may have been biased starting this book because Harlan Coben is MY FAVORITE AUTHOR EVER. I mean, I fan girl over him like teens did over the Beatles and Elvis back in the day. So I pretty much knew I would enjoy this as I have enjoyed every book previously. He never disappoints! This was a fast-paced thriller than included his usual snark and wit. He always brings the characters and story lines together brilliantly. READ THIS BOOK (AND ANYTHING ELSE BY COBEN) - you won't be disappointed!!!!
Thanks to Harlan Coben, Grand Central Publishing and NetGalley for the ARC of this fantastic book!",4

Bennett","198211598X","R37BB5QVH6N5A5","1555361485","**This review is a comparison of the book and the movie (with Nicholson and Duvall). The reason is for ones like me that saw the movie and wasn't sure why they would need to read the book.** I love reading Stephen King though I admit I have a lot more books of his to read. I tend to pass over his books that were turned to movies since I initially know what they are about. Same with this book. My decision to read it was because he came out with Doctor Sleep which is a follow up to The Shining. I was told by a few who read the book and seen the movie that they are not quite the same. So I jumped into this one so I could read Doctor Sleep (all the time thinking it might be a waste of time though). I was wrong! Though I do love Stanley Kubrick's movie, I could also see why King was disappointed with it. There is so much more depth in the book (which there almost always is). But this was to a point you could almost understand the madness that Jack went through (unlike the movie where he pretty much seemed like a jerk  from the beginning). The book shows his love for his family and his family's love for him. His son idolizes him to the point it almost makes Wendy jealous. This is not something that is shown in the movie. I believe it is a big factor. It shows how strong these ""ghosts"" were to tear Jack down like that. There are also differences like Wendy's description is nothing like Shelley Duvall, the relationship between Danny and Dick Halloran is more intense in the book, and the ending was totally different. Even with all of that, I still love the movie but now I can say I love the book as well for the same and different reasons.",5

"1050","Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the…","Cracking read on the history of coders, coding and software ... and their future","Aran Joseph Canes","0735220565","R1BG7R514F4JNJ","1555365558","As a former tech reporter myself, and--full disclosure--a friend of the author, I'm predisposed to like this book. However, even were I not, Coders resonates as a necessary book for our current moment.

At no other time in recent history has software and the people who make it been more critical to how we experience the world. Thanks to the current ""pics or it didn't happen"" mentality, Thompson's talent at digging into the personalities and the quirks of the mostly men (and the few women) who write the code that we rely on to stay in touch with loved ones, share experiences, shop, consume media, etc., should make readers to think about how the foundations of so much of daily life are produced.

He deftly exhumes the history of the software industry from its early days when coding was considered secretarial labor (and thus left to the ladies) to today's more male-dominated environment, where software bros chase the big score. He asks the right questions: Why did this happen and what was the effect of that shift? What are the knock-on impacts when coders are overwhelmingly white (or Asian), male, and convinced of their own overweening intelligence? Is the current, toxic environment found online solely because humans can be pretty awful to one another? Or is it because the guys who coded the platform just didn't think about online abuse because they never had to? Did that ignorance lead them to unwittingly enable the abuse, fake news, and mob culture we now have to endure? Thompson convincingly argues that a fair amount of that ignorance is at fault.

Ultimately, code doesn't just happen; humans with their weirdo attitudes, biases, ideologies, and faults write it, and they tend to encode into the code itself those very same attitudes, biases, ideologies, and faults -- whether they mean to or not. That's why it's important to understand the history of coders and the code they write. Given how important software is to the modern world -- a glitch at one airport can disrupt airline traffic all over the world, just to name one recent example -- we also have to know who the authors are.

Thompson's book does that, and with a verve, style, and brisk pace that makes Coders a readable, engaging, and valuable addition to this field of study.",4

It's goose bumps on your flesh creepy, the characters are well written (as I find is almost always the case with Stephen King) and even though I was reading it for the third time, I didn't want to stop til the very last page.Danny is a little boy with a very powerful ""gift"". He can see the dead, and he can hear thoughts even before he has the capacity to understand what those thoughts mean. Danny has a spirit guide named Tony who tries to warn him of the danger to come, but the danger is more than Tony or Danny can ward off. That danger has a lot to do with Danny's own father, who Danny loves very much. Danny is only 6 or so, there is no escaping his fate.Campbell Scott did an excellent job as narrator.If you like scary stories and you haven't read the Shining yet, I strongly recommend it.",5

"1153","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Pet Semitary","scott Thompson","198211598X","R2IM8BWEMLQ4FQ","1555374047","In Pet Semitary Stephen King uses many different literary devices, but one that stands out the most is foreshadowing. In the novel John and his family move into a new house and meet some interesting neighbors across the street. They tell him about a trucking company that used to drive through the neighborhood all the time and would end up hitting the people's pets. The kids took their pets to a field after they got hit and bury them giving it the name Pet Semitary. John's daughter terry owns a cat and they talked about how in their old house they were secluded and the cat didn't have to worry about crossing the street and getting hit. Stephen King foreshadows the cat getting hit by a car because their new neighbors were warning them about keeping their cat inside as much as possible because animals always seem to get hit on the street they live on.The author, Stephen King, also foreshadows the animals coming back to life. The neighbor said that he herd of peoples pets coming back and haunting them, almost like a revenge for not keeping them safe and that is why people keeping moving in and out of that house. All of the previous owners pets are still in the house haunting it and when the cat gets hit and comes back with the other animals it is expected. I just knew that they were going to come and haunt the family because of the foreshadowing.Stephen King also uses personification in his novel Pet Semitary. When the animals come back to haunt the house he has them talking to each other. They also talk to John and his family and their cat especially because it yells at the family and writes messages on the wall. This is personification because the animals are given human characteristics. Not only do the animals talk and write they are also organized like a group of humans would be organized. This isn't completely personification but the way they are acting is much like a human therefore making them different then just animals.",4

"1159","Kushner, Inc.: Greed. Ambition. Corruption. The Extraordinary Story of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump","AN INFORMATIVE BOOK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT’S DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW","Steven H Propp","1250185947","RKO1I1V6NRBS1","1555374646","Author Vicky Ward wrote in the Prologue to this 2019 book, “Donald Trump… was celebrating being sworn in as president… And the whole world knew that his daughter and son-in-law were his most trusted advisers, ambassadors, and coconspirators. They were an attractive couple---extremely wealthy and, now, extraordinarily powerful. Ivanka looked like Cinderella… Ivanka and her husband swept onto the stage, deftly deflecting attention from Donald Trump’s clumsy moves, as she had done do often over the past twenty years. The crowd roared in approval… They were now America’s prince and princess.”She notes, “Jared Kushner learned about the company [his father’s] he would later run. Jared was the firm’s most sheltered trainee. On his summer vacations, he’d go to work at Kushner Companies construction sites, maybe painting a few walls, more often sitting and listening to music… No one dared tell him this probably would not give him a deep understanding of the construction process. But Charlie [Jared’s father] doggedly groomed his eldest son for greatness, seeing himself… as a Jewish version of Joseph Kennedy…” (Pg. 17-18)She states, “Ivanka had to fight for her father’s attention and her ultimate role as the chief heir in his real estate empire… When Donald Trump divorced her mother, Ivana… she would go out of her way to see more of her father, not less… she’d call him during the day… and to her delight, he’d always take her call. (Trump’s relationship with the two sons he had with Ivana, Don Jr. and Eric, was not nearly so close for years.) ‘She was always Daddy’s little girl,’ said… a family friend.” (Pg. 32-33) She adds, “As Ivanka matured, physically and emotionally, her father talked openly about how impressed he was with her appearance---a habit he has maintained to this day.” (Pg. 35)She recounts, “at a networking lunch thrown by a diamond heir… Jared was introduced to Ivanka … Jared and Ivanka quickly became an intriguing gossip column item. They seemed perfectly matched… But after a year of dating, they split… in part because Jared’s parents were … dismayed at the idea of their son marrying outside the faith… Soon after, Ivanka agreed to convert to Judaism… Trump was said to be discombobulated by the enormity of what his daughter had done. Trump, a Presbyterian, who strikes no one as particularly religious, was baffled by his daughter’s conversion… ‘Why should my daughter convert to marry anyone?’” (Pg. 51-53)She observes, “Ivanka Trump was critical in promoting her husband as the smoother, softer counterpart to his father’s volatility.. they could both work a room, ask after people’s children, talk without notes, occasionally fake a sense of humor… And unlike her husband, she seemed to have a ready command of figures and a detail, working knowledge of all the properties she was involved in… Ivanka seemed to control the marital relationship, but she also played the part of devoted, traditional Orthodox wife.” (Pg. 70-71)Of 2016, she states, “No one thought Kushner or Ivanka believed in Trump’s populist platform. ‘The two of them see this as a networking opportunity,’ said a close associate. Because Kushner and Ivanka only fully immersed themselves in Trump’s campaign once he became the presumptive Republican nominee… they had to push to assert themselves with the campaign staff… Kushner quickly got control of the campaign’s budget, but he did not have as much authority as he would have liked.” (Pg. 74-75) She adds, “Ivanka appeared thrilled by her husband’s rising prominence in her father’s campaign. It was a huge change from the days when Trump had made belittling jokes about him. If Don Jr. and Eric were irked by the new favorite in Trump’s court, they did not show it publicly.” (Pg. 85)She points out, “Trump tweeted an image [Hillary with a backdrop of money and a Star of David] widely viewed as anti-Semitic… an ‘Observer’ writer, criticized Kushner in his own newspaper for standing ‘silent and smiling in the background’ while Trump made ‘repeated accidental winks’ to white supremacists… Kushner wrote a response… [that] insisted that Trump was neither anti-Semitic nor a racist… Not all of Kushner’s relatives appreciated his efforts to cover Trump’s pandering to white supremacists.” (Pg. 86-87) Later, she adds, “U.S.-Israel relations was the one political issue anyone in the campaign ever saw Kushner get worked up about.” (Pg. 96)On election night, “Kushner was shocked that Trump never mentioned him in his speech and would later tell people he felt slighted. He was going to find a way to get Trump to notice him more… Ivanka would help him… the couple would become known as a single, powerful entity: ‘Javanka.’” (Pg. 101) She suggests, “Kushner was increasingly caught up in his own mythology. He was the president’s son-in-law, so he apparently thought he was untouchable.” (Pg. 114) She notes, “allowing Kushner to work in the administration… broke with historical precedent, overruling a string of Justice Department memos that … concluded it was illegal for presidents to appoint relatives as White House staff.” (Pg. 119)She observes, “Those first few days were chaotic for almost everyone in the new administration. A frantic Reince Priebus would quickly discover that it was impossible to impose any kind of order in this White House, in large part because Trump didn’t like order. What Trump liked was having people fight in front of him and then he’d make a decision, just like he’d made snap decisions when his children presented licensing deals for the Trump Organization. This kind of dysfunction enabled a ‘floater’ like Kushner, whose job was undefined, to weigh in on any topic in front of Trump and have far more influence than he would have had in a top-down hierarchy.” (Pg. 125)She recounts, “Another epic [Steve] Bannon/Ivanka fight came when bannon was in the Oval Office dining room while Trump was watching TV and eating his lunch… Ivanka marched in, claiming Bannon had leaked H.R. McMaster’s war plan… [Bannon said] ‘No, that was leaked by McMaster…’ Trump [told her], ‘Hey, baby, I think Steve’s right on this one…’ Bannon thought he would be fired on the spot… But he’d learned something important: much as Trump loved his daughter and hated saying no to her, he was not always controlled by her.” (Pg. 138-139)She notes, “[Ivanka] also found a way to be near Trump when he received phone calls from foreign dignitaries---while she still owned her business… While Ivanka’s behavior was irritating, Kushner was playing a game on a whole different level: he was playing for serious money… at the time of the Qatari blockade… Kushner’s family had been courting the Qataris for financial help and had been turned town. When that story broke … the blockade and the Trump administration’s response to it suddenly all made sense.” (Pg. 156)Arguing that “Kushner was behind the decision to fire [FBI Director James] Comey” (Pg. 163-164), “Quickly, Trump realized he’d made an error, and blamed Kushner… It seemed clear to Trump’s advisers, and not for the first time, that he wished Kushner were not in the White House. He said to Kushner in front of senior staff, ‘Just go back to New York, man…’” (Pg. 167) She adds, “[Ivanka’s] reluctance to speak frankly to her father was the antithesis of the story she had been pushing in the media… Ivanka had told Gayle King… ‘Where I disagree with my father, he knows it. And I express myself with total candor.’” (Pg. 170)She states, “at the Group of 20 summit in Germany… she briefly took her father’s seat when he had to step out… The gesture seemed to send the message that the U.S. government was now run on nepotism.” (Pg. 182)E-mails from George Nader [an adviser to Shiekh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi] “made it clear that Kushner’s friends in the Gulf mocked him behind his back… Nader wrote… ‘Nobody would even waste a cup of coffee on him if it wasn’t for who he was married to.’” (Pg. 206)She points out, “since October 2017, hundreds of children had been taken from their parents while attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border and detained separately… news shows everywhere showed heartbreaking images of young children being detained. The next month, Ivanka posted on Instagram a photograph of herself holding her youngest child… in his pajamas. Not for the first time, her tone-deaf social media post was slammed as being isolated in her elitist, insulated wealthy world… On June 20, Trump signed an executive order that apparently ended the border separations. Minutes later, Ivanka finally spoke publicly on the issue… Her tactic here was… tell the public you care about an issue; watch silently while your father does the exact opposite; and when he moves a little, take all the credit.” (Pg. 225)She asserts, “Kushner’s friendship with a Saudi crown prince was now under widespread scrutiny… [because] Rather than expressing moral outrage over the cold-blooded murder of an innocent man [Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi], Kushner did what he always does in a crisis: he went quiet.” (Pg. 232)She concludes, “Ivanka Trump has made no secret of the fact that she wants to be the most powerful woman in the world. Her father’s reign in Washington, D.C., is, she believes, the beginning of a great American dynasty… Ivanka has been carefully positioning herself as [Trump’s] political heir…” (Pg. 236)While not as “scandalous” as the book’s subtitle might suggest, this is a very interesting book that will be of great interest to those wanting information about these crucial members of the Trump family and presidency.",5

Unlike other nations which expel ""undesirables"", Russia can exile political prisoners internally.  The Count is placed under house arrest at the luxurious Metropol Hotel in the heart of Moscow. At first, what might seem to be a very small world, is anything but that.  For over three decades, the reader experiences the metamorphosis of an aristocrat as well as makes the  acquaintance of many of the hotel's quirky staff and some of its regular guests.  Along the way, Amor Towles teaches about Russian history, literature, and culture as well as the delights of good wines and haut cuisine.  Some may find the novel's ending ""unsettled"", but this reader thought, ""Bravo! Bravo!"".  THE RULES of CIVILITY was good, but A GENTLEMAN IN MOSCOW is terrific!

First problem: the 100% predictable storyline. There are NO surprises whatsoever, but there are  any number of situations that strain credulity. For example, it is extremely unlikely that a college freshman would be assigned a sophomore dorm-mate, but especially one with NO common intetests.  Co-ed floor bathrooms at a state u? Very unusual, too.  Three (+) blowout parties a week at a single fraternity house with underage  drinking and drugs wouldn't go unnoticed in thisvday/age, (etc.) There's too much fantasy college and ""Animal House"" stereotyping here, and nothing resembling reality.Secondly, the ""romance"" is not at all romantic. There is abusive, manipulative, jealous be havior at every turn. No one can talk like an adult - they just curse, scream, cry, and sob. Still, we are supposed to believe there is great understanding and a deep respect/love between two (damaged) people. Not that we ever get to read anything indicative of this, other than eventual trite declarations of ""I love you"" and repetitive decriptions of (unimaginative) basic sexual techniques for teens. (Ho hum.)But truly, the worst is that when it finally seems like thete is acyually an interesting development in the story -- it would be hard to say it is a ""plot"" -- the book simply QUITS.  There is no denouement, because the author, after this volume of 580 pages, has a further FOUR ADDITIONAL BOOKS to sell (at $11.99 each) to ostensibly complete the ""series."" It'd be nice to COMPLETE one story before setting out to write four companion volumes -  If it really takes 2500 pages to tell this tale, then I do not want to read it.",1

"1221","Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder","Deserved its Pulitzer","M Arneson","1627792767","R2W3WY5FNAR4I0","1555379237","Even though this book deals with circumstances that occurred more than 100 years ago, it is timely in many ways--especially given the fires in California. This book depicts, for example, how Westward movement created environmental destruction that led to the Dust Bowl. The book also shines light on political dynamics around resistance to the New Deal that I found fascinating (and frustrating). And of course there is the truth of what westward expansion did to the indigenous people, much of which I already knew, but the way it is contextualized in this book is powerful. For example, one of the first ""little houses on the prairie"" was not built by Pa Ingalls but was a house belonging to an Indian family that had gone hunting. This was an illegal practice many pioneers established: stealing not just Indians' land but their actual dwellings.

All of this historical background is woven into the story of the life of Laura Ingalls Wilder. The ""half-pint"" of the TV show and books IS and IS NOT the true Laura, whose life was one of harsh struggle and deep loss. One thing I was surprised to learn was that her family never was able to support themselves as small famers (true for most)--and as a girl she had to help support the family by working.

I also hadn't realized she had a hell-on-wheels daughter--nor that she didn't start writing until her sixties. It was the popularity of her books that finally provided her with some financial stability.

The scope of this book is fascinating. I understand why it won the Pulitzer.",4

This book is, quite frankly amazing. If you own many plant based books, you will quickly begin to recognize the same recipes replicated over and over again with maybe tiny tweaks to make them unique. This is certainly not the case in this book - the recipes are largely unique, and kudos for the fact that the vast majority of the ingredients are things you could find in any major supermarket. The book is also bright, fresh and full of colorful pictures of the featured dishes.

Its part story book and pa recipe book as it begins with the authors stories, the story behind Sakara and some basic detail about the ""eat clean, play dirty"" mantra.....which just note, you will need to be a lover of your greens as this lifestyle emphasizes six to eight cups of greens a day but does come full of suggestions to getting them into your diet.

The chapters then include breakfast, lunch, dinner, dressings, desserts and cocktails . There are so many enticing recipes. Nothing too complicated and most if not all can be accomplished without necessitating expensive equipment or crazy amounts of prep time.

I plan on routinely making the Green bars - packed with seeds, sweetened with fruit and taken up a notch with Chlorella. The salads will be my go to this summer and both the salads and home made dressings are very easy to prepare. I love the Taco salad with Walnut Chorizo as it avoids using fake meats and ups the protein with the nuts. The Red Beet burgers are almost a make your own ""Beyond Meat"" burger and pretty simple to prepare.

There are some heavier main meals which would be ideal for the cooler weather and a wide range of desserts and the strawberry 'Chia-sicles' will be a go to for me as we are already hitting 90 degrees and what a neat way to keep the kids healthy. It ends with some beautiful cocktails which will be perfect for the upcoming summer months!

Simply love this book, the recipes and the creativity. Cannot wait to keep preparing these dishes!",5
"1258","When We Left Cuba","Suspenseful and romantic","Rachel M","045149086X","R2FXGQFPYGGT99","1555383019","I fell in love with Next Year In Havana telling anyone and everyone that they had to read it. At the end of it was a little snippet from Beatriz's perspective that kind of dropped a bombshell on readers. Waiting for an entire year to get the whole story was not easy but it was so worth it!

Where Next Year In Havana played on nostalgia, When We Left Cuba is all about malcontent followed by action. Beatriz was never satisfied being a socialite and behaving like a proper lady - much to her mother's chagrin - in the hopes of capturing a husband. It wasn't what she enjoyed doing in Cuba either and it certainly is not something she likes doing in America even if means securing her status here. Her end goal has always been to go back home. America is a temporary stop. Most of her passion and hatred for Castro is fueled by her twin brother's murder at the hands of the man who controls her beloved country. She has deigned to take on her brother's mantel and work with rebels who seek to depose Castro. It's a dangerous road to go down on but Beatriz has never been a rule follower and signs on to work covertly with the CIA. She's not going to sit idly by while her country suffers. In a case of bad timing, Beatriz has attracted the attention of a young US senator, Nicholas ""Nick"" Preston whose star is on the rise. Only he's spoken for but it doesn't stop those longing gazes and brief stolen moments they steal for themselves.

There's a recurring theme throughout the novel (other than Castro must go) and it's Beatriz's determination to not be defined by the men in her life. She adamantly refuses to be controlled by anyone and demands to be seen as an equal capable of making her own decisions and taking on danger should she choose to do so. There's also a relative amount of suspense considering the espionage and political climate of the era, and she finds herself in the midst of some incredibly sensitive or volatile situations. Her affair with Nick provides a counterbalance to all the plotting she gets embroiled in. Their contrasting perspectives on Cuba and the American government's involvement are the constant background to their own drama.

At some point Beatriz's fierce declarations of revenge against Castro become repetitive but it's also understandable. Her body is in Palm Beach but her heart is in Cuba so she's never felt truly at home in America. She feels displaced and helpless, so her anger is what she can hold on to to give her purpose. Granted, she and her family are financially in far better shape than many of their countryman who escaped. I think she comes to realize it as time wears on and she sees how in some ways she was insulated from what a lot of Cubans faced.

Cleeton's writing evokes the glamourous and tense atmosphere of that era. She had me envisioning the vibrant settings and sounds, and more than that, she gave me a history lesson. What I knew of the Cold War was solely from history class and honestly, I don't remember much of it. What she's done here is personalize these events, seeing them through the eyes of those displaced by the revolution. I remember from Next Year in Havana the mention of a sense of heavy guilt for leaving and also for not staying to fight. Cleeton made these challenges personal and reminded me of the people who were affected, whose lives were uprooted and who had to lay down new roots uncertain of what the future would hold, uncertain of whether to call America home or hold out hope that they would go home.

"1274","Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder","Extremely detailed","M Arneson","1627792767","R1W1MB0Z44U2HJ","1555385317","I grew up reading the Little House on the Prairie (LHOP) books and watching the TV series. To me, Melissa Gilbert was Laura Ingalls Wilder and Michael Landon, Charles. Melissa and I were born a month apart, Laura and I both clumsy compared to our more perfect siblings both facts made my kinship with LIW feel even more real.

When PRAIRIE FIRES was on a one day Kindle sale for $2.99, I grabbed the Pulitzer Prize winning biography, expecting an adult experience like I had with Little House. I knew LIW factionalized her experiences in the LHOP books and even more so in the TV series. I hoped for at the very least an interesting account of Wilder’s life.

Caroline Fraser’s exhaustive research left no minor detail unwritten. I found myself skimming over census data, great grandparents and even ancestry dating back to a Salem witchcraft hysteria victim. Fraser’s frequent tangents, which important if I was studying the LIW in a historical context, mostly didn’t interest me. Salem was a sidestep that did interest me, weather statistics, blights and locusts, not so much.

PRAIRIE FIRES is over 600 pages, including references and pictures. I would have preferred a 200 page narrative nonfiction about LIW’s life. Laura’s childhood interested me most, particularly seeing how her real life diverged from fiction. I enjoyed reading about the real people in different areas the Ingalls had lived and remembering their fictional versions.

While reading, I wondered how much Fraser’s own opinions influenced her narrative, particularly around Laura’s jealousy of Mary, which to Fraser seemed slightly pathological and to me seemed like typical sibling rivalry. I also wondered if LIW’s daughter Rose Wilder Lane was as horrible as she seemed to be.

PRAIRIE FIRES isn’t the story of Laura Ingalls Wilder’s life I would have told, but I was also impressed with how Fraser brought historical, cultural and biological information into the book. I didn’t enjoy reading PRAIRIE FIRES, but I’m glad I read the story, if that makes sense.",4

This book has lit my imagination on fire! These games are so much fun. I’m currently playing through ‘Adventure’ I’ll try an explain what I’ve been through so far.So, it all started with me, Shawn Weston, as a child, I was at my friend’s house for a sleep over, one morning we woke up and I forgot to remind my friend to take his vitamin for the day. He died in the next few hours. On that day I vowed to never let anyone suffer like that again. Flash forward to today, Cairo 1940. I read in an Encyclopedia Britannica that Egyptian god Imhotep had a secret health elixir hidden deep inside the great pyramid. With my guide Hassan and an ancient map we have begun our quest to discover this elixir.Upon entry to the great pyramid we encountered our first booby trap! The passageway behind us slammed shut and the floor in front of us started to retract inwards towards us creating an ever growing gap to the slowly closing door at the other end. Hassan and I began to sprint to the other end of the passageway only to discover that the gap was too far to jump and the door was closing to quickly on the other end. In a panic Hassan and I took our rope and hook and threw it underneath the door as it closed and we fell off the receding floor. SLAM! We swung into the opposing wall on the other side underneath the closed door, helpless. As we hung suspended by our ropes, me, not being the strongest struggled to hang on and dropped my torch in the process. I watched it fall as it illuminated the bottomless pit below us. Then I saw it, an out of place shadow. Hassan and I lowered ourselves down quickly to find a secret ledge leading to a passage way 40 feet below us. Hassan and I swung down onto the ledge. PHEW! A close one, any longer and my arms for sure would have given up on me.Now going down the passageway we discovered a mossy field, roughly 50 yards by 50 yards. Skeptical I took a bone from a nearby dead skeleton and tossed it into the mossy field. SIZZLE! The bone fell right through the moss into a pool of acid below. Scary! Some sort of mossy algae must have grown over the acid to disguise such a deadly trap. Using the bones of the skeleton Hassan and I poked at the secret acid pool to discover stepping stones scattered every few feet. Poking and hopping on the stones we made it to the other side. In this time. We heard pick axes echoing through the chambers.My rival Klaus had arrived it seemed, the pressure was on. Klaus works for the Germans. There’s no way I was going to let him get to the elixir before me and on top of that, he had modern tools to help him, along with German soldiers at his disposal. That’s makes him a cheater, he doesn’t deserve to win.Following our map we found the next chamber, this trap was a classic, pressure sensitive pads on the floor that triggered deadly arrows. Easy. The next obstacle stumped us. It was a water fall. While a sight to see we didn’t know what to do. We could hear Klaus and his men getting closer. With no ideas left, Hassan and I jumped down the water fall. Lucky for us there was a deep pool at the bottom. Hassan and I gasped for air as Klaus and his men ran in at the top of the waterfall. Klaus unleased a fury storm of bullets on us. Hassan and I took a deep breath and went under the water. Bullets whizzed into the water as we looked for a desperate escape, lungs burning and yearning for oxygen we found it, an underwater tunnel leading to the next chamber. With moments left before blacking out Hassan pulled me out of the water into the dry tunnel. I gasped for air. I had never held my breath for that long before. We started to head down the tunnel to find that it split into 4 separate passageways.I reached for our map only to find that the water had rubbed off all the markings on it. RATS! What to do. Hassan and I started to talk things through. During this however my mom called me to dinner, so I had to hid pause on the game for now. I can’t wait to get back to playing though.These games seem to be as fun as your imagination is! I highly recommend getting this book to play the games. They are so realistic!For those wondering how the book is set up. Adventure is set up in the following. They give a few prompts/points to consider for creating your character. This includes things like age, gender, occupation, backstory. Then it helps you set up a goal that your are going for. Along with your main antagonistic force. There's also a few things mentioned to help you figure out and set up the scenerio/story your bout to begin. Then whatever you have in your head you just go with it and play it all out based on what you defined previously.",5

"1288","Free to Focus: A Total Productivity System to Achieve More by Doing Less","A modern system to getting the RIGHT things done!!","S Prabhu","0801075262","R1899UPO77Y05A","1555386700","I was lucky enough to get early access to an electronic version of Michael Hyatt’s new book, Free to Focus. However, the best testimonial for the book is that I bought a hard copy of the book for my bookshelf.
I read the book around 4 weeks back on a weekend, stopping to complete some of the thinking exercises Michael suggests as one proceeds through the book. Here are my most powerful takeaways from the book-
1. Stop to think about what success means to me, and review tasks I am doing and instead think in terms of ways to complete projects that really take me forward in my journey. Michael rightly says it is not “getting things done”, it is more about “getting the right things done”.
With this paradigm shift in thinking, I have been able to complete a number of daily tasks and habits for the last month since I read the book using the pointers in the book.
2. Thinking of the activities during the week in terms of morning and evening rituals, on stage, off stage and backstage activities. This is a powerful way to think about what one does during the week, and in my case, made me feel less guilty about the times when I was recovering from intense focused work by spending time with the kids, exercising or reading a book, as this off stage activity is important to sustain the on stage activity.
3. Celebrating wins along the way. While this seems common sense, this can be hard to remember to do consistently, both as an individual and as a leader of a team. I have made marks on my calendar where I will pause, congratulate myself and the team for work well done and course correct if things are not going to plan.
4. Saying “no” to something means saying “yes” to something that is more valuable. I have declined good offers over the last month that I would have normally said yes to and I actually good about this!
5. Dividing goals into achievement and habit goals and having the “SMARTER” goal set up in my planner has helped make some activities that were normally a drag into a rather enjoyable habit.

I combined the teachings in this book with two other books I read recently- Atomic Habits by James Clear and Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport and I feel this is a nice trifecta of books that should be on every productive person’s self. And to quote Michael Hyatt, “productive” does not mean getting more things done faster through hacks, rather getting the right things done as steps towards completing big projects that move the needle forward.
Needless to say, I highly recommend this book!!",5

So in love in fact, that I am completely devastated this is not a real band, because I want to be able to listen to all the music and read more stories about them!Taylor Jenkins Reid is a powerhouse author who manages to create characters that are so real, flawed, broken, lovable and human that you cannot help but love them, root for them and wish that you never had to say good bye to a single one of them.  This story explodes from the page with passion, and that would just not be possible without the cast she brings together on the page.I also completely loved the format of this book - told as an oral history of the band, in an interview format, the story speeds along so quickly, you cannot believe it when you find yourself nearing the end of the book.  I wanted to read faster and slower every single page of this book - and I ADORED where Taylor took this story and ended the tale.

Rachel’s “Girl, Wash Your Face” wrecked me in the best way. Yet, I just wasn’t sure about this one.Well, it’s great. It’s even more practical than GWYF with specific action steps and behaviors to put into practice. It’s straightforward while giving space for each woman to make the wisdom work for them. Once again, Rachel said exactly what I didn’t know I needed to hear.I’d be lying if I said I agreed with everything or with how it is presented. (For example, ambition and hard work only get you so far. I mean, you can’t win American Idol if you literally can’t sing. And while I like her definition of hustle, I can’t get behind the application 100%.) That doesn’t detract from the overall chunks of wisdom. Excuse 5: I Can’t Pursue My Dream and Still Be A Good Mom & Excuse 6: I’m Terrified Of Failure are worth the price of the book alone. With a little discernment, this book will help you take your next step in your journey.If you know you are meant for more but keep sabotaging yourself with lies and excuses, this book is for you. Whether you just want to run that race or start a non-profit or climb the corporate ladder or be a better version of you, this book is for you. Read it and you may just have what you need to change your life.I did get a free copy of the book to review from the publisher. Words and thoughts are my own. Nobody tells me what to think. ;)",4

This book was quite interesting as it was a new take on ""dieting"" with fasting being involved. There is a lot to take in with this book. You do need to follow a plan and know what you are doing, and I feel at this point that I would need to go back to the beginning and take notes on how to follow her 131 method. The three stages of Ignite, Nourish and Renew are still a bit muddled in my brain, but as I was reading them, they made sense at the time. To be honest though, this isn't a plan I am going to follow, at least not at the moment. I prefer to not eat meat, and there are ways to get around that with this plan. I can see it inspiring people, and some of the recipes in the back of the book sound extremely good. I do have to watch sodium levels, and the amounts of sodium in recipes are not listed but one can estimate which items are high in sodium. She did also write that ""recent science finds that people over the age of 60 who have high LDL cholesterol actually live longer than people with low LDL."" Hmm, news to me as I just read the book by Caldwell Esselstyn (Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease), and he explains quite a bit about atherosclerosis and the importance of lowering cholesterol and LDL by a plant based diet. Plus, as I had some atherosclerosis, I was advised to take a statin to lower cholesterol. It makes it difficult to know what to believe is the best diet/food for oneself. I think this book has some excellent points in it and it will increase your knowledge about nutrition, gut health and metabolism. I will be keeping it on my bookshelf and trying out a few of the recipes for sure.",4

Even from far away Africa I identified with her life and the changing landscape. This is a history of America — a history of the conquest of the west, the destruction of the indigenous people and the land. It’s a record of the impact of colonial settlers on the landscape. It’s a record of how greed impacted on the landscape and on society. It’s a record of famine, corruption, exploitation — how cycles of greed, weather conditions, drought, famine repeat. The cycle of good presidents, bad presidents, downright evil presidents and their policies that wreak havoc. We learn nothing from the past.
Besides being a biography of how the west was won and homesteaded, it is a biography of Laura Ingalls-Wilder. The second half of the book gives itself over to the relationship between Laura her daughter Rose, a challenging relationship). Rose, also a writer, encouraged her mother to write her story late in her life. She said Laura should stop saving money but rather make money. Very different from Laura, Rose was an opportunist, teetering on the edge of honesty. She liberally edited her mother’s work, stole her ideas, competed as a writer.

Six</i>. It is written in documentary format and doesn't read like a fiction nor could I find anything in my kindle version that spelled out the fact that it was all fiction; therefore, I couldn't decide in the beginning if any of it was real. I ended up googling Daisy Jones and the various members of The Six just to be sure. It was that convincing.This book reminds me of the movie  ""<i>Almost Famous</i>."" It follows a band in the 1970's on its way to both fame and self destruction. It covers the relationships of its members; their struggles and triumphs focusing mainly on Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne. It captures the time; the whole groupie scene, ""<i>the sex drugs and rock & roll</i>"" era. The story culminates in the band falling apart at the height of their fame, everything leading up to the implosion causing the split. The slow accumulation of jealousy, both petty annoyances and major betrayals.<b>WHAT I LOVED</b>This is a very character driven story. While there is a lot of action, most of the action is based on the character's thoughts, feelings and reactions to situations. In order to make that work, the characters must be interesting and well developed, and each of the characters were.The format works very well for this story. I truly appreciate the way Reid wove the story together, it took a lot of creativity and imagination to create this book.I loved hearing the story from so many points of view; it was interesting to see how people often saw the same situation so differently.<b>WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE</b>I loved almost everything about this book, but there were a couple places where it dragged, mostly during the parts where they were working on lyrics.<b>OVERALL</b>What a great, highly entertaining book. It's not for kids though, there was a lot of sex and drugs.",4

I've read every one and plan one day to go back and start from #1 again. What a great series; she sure has come a long way. This wasn't my favorite in the series, but I still enjoyed it a lot. The characters are what make this series, in my opinion. Some of the stories are great and others a little less so. This particular book was kind of convoluted and slow to get under way. At times it seemed to be all over the place.

I like the time spent at Chelstone with the extended family, and the fact that James' parents see Maisie as a daughter. I adore Anna and think she adds so much to the mix; watching her grow up will add a nice touch to the whole series (as will Mark Scott! ;-).

One thing that I wondered about was the title. Catherine was not any kind of an 'American Agent' that I could see, unless I missed something important. So I don't understand the title. I guess it could refer to Scott, but the titles usually relate to the main storyline/murder. In any event, now we have to wait another year to see these characters again. I'm already looking forward to the next one.",5

MULLIGAN","006243666X","R3L74091LOA39B","1555413402","The title is something of a misnomer -- perhaps a bit of a tease for where Maisie's life is headed next, since ""the American agent"" plays only a peripheral role in this episode. That aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, which I finished all in a rush late last night. Maisie's adult life has now encompassed two world wars, a personal rise from household downstairs maid to trusted investigator and advisor in the mold of her mentor, who is no longer with us in this world but always present to her in spirit and counsel. (I often take his advice myself!) It has been a pleasure to watch both Maisie's brilliant career and her personal relationships with family, friends, men, and children unfold as she matures and absorbs wisdom from every source she encounters. Her lifelong friendship with Priscilla is a delight --two such different women with such different lives appreciating and advising and deeply loving one another. Rarely is female friendship portrayed with such affectionate insight.

Of particular interest at this point in Maisie's life is the setting in early WW2 London, with the blliz forcing daily races to shelter, the city burning around its citizens, and the legendary resolute response of the British people on full display. At this point in time, the United States is controlled by an isolationist faction, the Allied Alliance still lies in the future, and the efforts of Roosevelt and other leaders in the U.S. and Britain to inform and persuade the American people of the necessity of their entrance into the war play a major part in the novel and its central mystery. Jacqueline Winspear does not wave flags beyond the natural sympathy her characters generate but, in light of today's political situation in both the US and the UK, the background related here is important for all of us to understand.

Most of these ""diet books"" seem to be pamphlet-size information with ""padding"" to make it book-length. Thus worth buying.

Ian Smith's book gives a 30 day program using ""clean"" foods, along with a program he calls ""Intermittent fasting"", which he writes about in great detail. He also gives a full 30 day-by-day menu, with fasting days indicated. Maybe some of it is padding but I think the reader will gain a lot of information about good ways to diet and clean yourself.

"1530","Two Weeks: A Novel (The Baxter Family)","A compelling story","Ann","147670743X","R2SJNZK503MWHV","1555414951","This story is wonderful.

Of all the many books that Karen Kingsbury has written, I think this is her most important one and has the most potential to influence lives. She tackles the difficult issue of teen pregnancy and the impact on family and friends. But more importantly, Karen Kingsbury has given a clarion call for choosing to save the baby’s life by rejecting abortion.

There is such compassion in this story for Elise, the young teenage mother who must difficult decisions about her baby. The author leads us through her decision making process as Elise considers abortion, adoption, or keeping the baby. Her emotions are treated with respect, but clearly show her inner turmoil of weighing the best options for herself as compared to the best options for the baby’s future.

As Elise makes her final decision to put the baby up for adoption, she has a two week option to change her mind once the baby is born. Her chosen adoptive parents, Aaron and Lucy, have not only experienced the loss of their own child, but also the loss of an adoptive child during a waiting period time.
Their story is a heart-tugging one, and we experience their difficult decisions, too. Daring to put their hearts on the line once more to have the chance to adopt a baby is a difficult decision that they must make.

There’s also a call for foster parenting in the storyline of Theo and Alma.
They experience great tragedy and foster parenting would seem to be the last thing they’d consider.
All of these storylines meet together and become a story that will keep you reading to the conclusion.

A note to the faithful readers of the Baxter Family series: DO NOT miss this book as it focuses on Landon, Ashley, and Cole. Their family comes together to help Elise, and Cole’s story is a major part of this book.

"1569","Someone Knows","Fascinating","J.K","0525539646","R119ROZ3X62G3C","1555418327","Lisa Scottolini’s standalone novel, Someone Knows is an intense novel that will grip readers immediately. Allie Garvey shares an ugly secret with a few others, and twenty years has passed since she and a group of her friends got drunk, handled a gun, and witnessed the death of an acquaintance when he shot himself playing Russian roulette. None of the group knows who loaded the gun, and none have mentioned the secret in the twenty years since it happened. At the time, they had all agreed to keep their involvement in the death a secret, and the police ruled the death a suicide without knowledge that the group witnessed the shooting; none of them were prosecuted. Allie has come back to her hometown to attend the funeral of one of the members of the group, and hopes that the guilt she has felt for twenty years will go away. Allie has punished herself throughout the years, and her guilt has affected every aspect of her life. Attending the funeral and expecting closure, Allie finds that things get worse, and as she tries to untangle the mysteries surrounding the incident, she finds herself in grave danger.

Scottolini is excellent at developing her characters, and she makes them appear believable; readers will put themselves in the position of the characters and relate to their plights. It seems that everyone knows someone in their lives who is similar to those in the novel, so it seems real. The novel is well-organized, and Scottolini’s writing style makes the book difficult to put down. The novel is very intense, and some of the issues are uncomfortable.

Someone Knows is an excellent novel for those who enjoy thrillers with intense plots and intense scenarios. The subject matter in this novel can be a bit unnerving, which will keep most readers on the edge of their seats. Close to the end, readers will think they have figured things out, but there is a twist at the end that will be totally unexpected.

Our series hero Cotton Malone returns, along with Stephanie Nelle and Cotton's heir apparent Luke, in another race-against-the-clock risky exploit full of evil villains and world-shaking secrets.While I enjoyed the story, I must confess I am growing weary of the ""world-shaking secrets"" so often coming back to the Vatican and Christianity. One of the reasons I keep reading Berry's work is that he really digs around to find or create ""secrets"" that range from roots in ancient civilizations to modern democracy. We all know the Catholic Church has screwed up the world in many ways and the premise here is slightly fresh but still tinged with the whole ""Popes Are Bad"" trope. That made this reading experience a little bland for me, only because I've read so much in the genre.Even so, I do always enjoy Steve Berry's work and this one will appeal to fans of the Cotton Malone series for sure. I'm also looking forward to the (hoped for) transition to Luke as the protagonist hero.",4

GWYF is a motivating read that had me wanting to prioritize and change my life. It was a book that showed us all the lies believe about ourselves. Girl, Stop Apologizing is a bit different as it goes through different excuses people make to not go after the goals they have for themselves.If you are at a point in your life that you’re striving for something, this is a book you could use. There were many quotes I wrote down to go over later because they inspired me. This is a book that doesn’t jus tell you to go after your goals, but it gives you tips and advice to go after them.

"1631","Lessons From Lucy: The Simple Joys of an Old, Happy Dog","A reminder to enjoy all of your loved ones","Grace Johnson","1501161156","R3SJFH2OD6200N","1555423522","I loved Dave Barry’s newspaper column back in the day, especially when he wrote about Earnest and Zippy. So, I jumped at the chance to read his latest book, Lessons from Lucy, combining as it did his trademark wit and stories about a dog.

Like Dave, I am the parent of an older large dog. I’m reading this book, at the point where Dave writes that “when we say her name or reach down to pet her, her tail thumps the floor in a drumbeat of joy”, at the same time that I’m petting Cooper, whose tail is thumping the floor in the same drumbeat.

There’s no new ground covered here. You could write out all the lessons without reading the book. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a fun book or that I didn’t laugh. I did. Sometimes out loud. So many of his stories hit home for me. “Whenever you see the word “motivational” used in a corporate training context, you should just substitute the word “stupid”.” Yup. Or when he recounts his fun with Comcast because I swear I’ve had the exact same conversation with those idiots.

It’s an extremely easy read and is perfect when you need an escape from the heavy dramas or psychological thrillers. And it reminds us of the most important lesson of all, that time is fleeting and we should enjoy it with our two and four legged loved ones.

Ironically, as the book opens, Lori's significant other, whom she calls Boyfriend, leaves her after they have been together for two years. He claims that he wants his freedom and has no interest in co-parenting Lori's eight-year-old son, Zach. Gottlieb feels betrayed, infuriated, and becomes so depressed that she frequently bursts into tears. Since she is having difficulty letting go of her fury and despair, she decides to visit a therapist herself.

In this rich, meaningful, and entertaining work of non-fiction, the author explains how talk therapy can be beneficial. Naysayers claim that it is impractical and expensive to visit a mental health practitioner for months or even years. Gottlieb asserts, however, that an individual who is fortunate enough to find the right therapist may acquire useful coping skills, achieve a measure of self-awareness, and find a path to joy and fulfillment. Gottlieb once said in an interview that ""we’re so afraid of the truth that sometimes we even hide it from ourselves."" One of a therapist's tasks is to help remove the blinkers from our eyes.

On one level, ""Maybe You Should Talk to Someone"" is an introduction to the art of psychotherapy. Gottlieb writes lucidly about therapeutic terminology, touches on the contributions of pioneers in the field, and provides insight into what can be accomplished if someone's treatment progresses well. The author has a marvelous sense of humor (much of it self-deprecating), and the case studies that she presents are intriguing. It is fascinating to observe Lori in session with John, a narcissistic, sarcastic, and obnoxious writer for a popular television series who believes that he is smarter and more competent than everyone else. Julie is a young woman who discovers shortly after her wedding that she may not have long to live. Rita, a gifted artist, has repeatedly failed at marriage and is estranged from her adult children. While Lori does her best to help her patients heal themselves, she also continues to visit her own therapist, whose guidance enables her to recognize why she has been obsessing so much about her ex-boyfriend. This is a candid, engrossing, and poignant book in which Lori Gottlieb suggests that psychotherapy can help us uncover the hidden truths about ourselves and pave the way for constructive change.",5

But the book was not very satisfying at all. The author is too judgemental and opinionated. She repeats her judgements throughout the book. Also, she tries to psycho-analyze the mother daughter relationship between Laura & Rose. I found it annoying that she kept referring to photographs that weren't shown in the book. (And one of Rose is particularly disturbing.) I usually am excited to recommend new books, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. In fact, as much as I love books, I am not going to keep this one because I will never want to reread it. Ironically, another book I didn't keep was one of the ""sequels"" written by a modern author.

It will make you laugh, cry, and inspire you to be more like that incredible man on the TV who always liked us no matter what. These poems encouraged my kids to open up more about fears and concerns that I didn't really know they had. We watch Mister Rogers and Daniel Tiger all the time in our home, but something about sitting down with them in the evening and reading through some of these really gets them talking. It's a beautiful way to end the day with your babies. A nice reminder of just how their little brains hold so much wonder about life and how desperately they look to us adults to help them understand it. Fred Rogers is one of the very best examples of how wonderful us humans can be when we decide to love everyone we meet...starting with the very smallest ones.",5

She is ambivalent about pursuing therapy, a reluctant participant and a decidedly non-compliant patient mixing copious amounts of liquor with random dosages of pharmaceuticals.  She indulges heavily in Hitchcock movies and watches her neighborhood through her windows.  Whether she sees something threatening or not, she is a dubious witness;  easily dissuaded from her point of view by her own panic attacks.  As a reader, it is a twisty tale, difficult to unwind and intensely interesting.  It’s not often we are treated to so many very tempting details in one sweet tale and this one delivers from beginning to end.  It is a delight for those readers who seek puzzles with answers that are well-hidden.  I received my copy from the publisher through edelweiss.",5

"1746","The Last Stone: A Masterpiece of Criminal Interrogation","Cold case solved","Jean Cole","0802147305","R2HFLM4M8OY4UM","1555431484","This extraordinary book about the long cold case of the kidnapping of the Lyons sisters decades ago in the Maryland suburbs of DC brought back memories I thought I’d long forgotten.

I lived in DC when the daughters of John Lyons, a local radio personality, and his wife, disappeared from the Wheaton Mall, apparently kidnapped, never to be heard from or seen again. While local police thought they had arrested the right suspect, there was never sufficient evidence to convict him, but he spent 30
years in jail nonetheless.

The book begins as he’s about to be released. An almost retired detective with eyes and ears for cold cases remembers the case when the release date draws near, and, not one for passing up an attempt to bring true justice to horrible people, starts talking to the guy (whose name escapes me right now) and in a masterpiece of detective work that no novelist, no matter how good, strings the kidnapper/killer along until there’s enough solid evidence to keep him in prison for the rest of his life.

While the family could never possibly recover from this tragedy, at least they are finally able to lay their daughters to rest in eternal peace.

Despite the horrendous circumstances that this book describes, it is a masterpiece of outstanding writing. I could barely put it down. It’s certainly not for the faint of heart. It’s just unimaginable that such horrible acts occur. And it’s remarkable when cases this cold are solved. My heart went out to the Lyons when this happened and it goes out to them again.

I received this book as an ARC from the publisher and NetGalley and give it my highest recommendation.",5

"1775","When We Left Cuba","So happy to have Beatriz's story!","Rachel M","045149086X","RQBO5P7NAGMVT","1555433535","As I was reading Next Year in Havana last year, I was so intrigued by the fiery and outspoken sister, Beatriz, and hoped that we would get to hear her story. Well, I got my wish and When We Left Cuba is all about Beatriz and what happened after her family was exiled from Cuba to southern Florida by the Castro regime in the 1960s. This striking story about a woman who makes it her mission to avenge her brother’s death and bring down the man responsible is riveting from beginning to end.

Beatriz’s tale is full of espionage, covert operations, and dangerous missions—but aside from her desire for revenge, she’s a woman who falls in love with a man who will never be able to leave his own sense of duty and obligation for her, she’s a woman who fights for her place in a society that looks down on her for being an outsider, and she’s a daughter who will never be a placid and demure wallflower looking to be taken care of by a husband. Beatriz is formidable and fierce and she doesn’t need a man to rescue her, thankyouverymuch.

Cleeton does such an amazing job of bringing both the United States and Cuba of the 1960s to life. The descriptions and imagery are vivid, the storytelling is sharp, and the characters pop off the page. There were a couple of places where the pacing felt heavy, but this is the kind of story that you can feel how much love and history has been poured into each chapter. If you love historical fiction with a side of glamour, romance, and intrigue, When We Left Cuba will be right up your alley and I highly recommend it.",5

"1787","The Third Pillar: How Markets and the State Leave the Community Behind","Inclusive Localism","David Shulman","525558314","R1XE3YT1K4PGS9","1555434524","Raghuram Rajan, a University of Chicago finance professor, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, former Chief Economist at the IMF and the one who blew the whistle on the dangers embedded in the derivatives markets at a 2005 Federal Reserve conference has written an important book on the political crisis of our time. Unfortunately it is too long and too dry. That said he is spot on in noting how the state and the market has taken over the historical role of community in our society. No wonder folks are alienated.He focuses in on the communities that have been left out of the global economy over the past fifty years from rural towns, isolated factory communities and the inner city. All of this being exacerbated by a flood of immigrants who put downward pressure on low end wages and upward pressure on rents and the geographic sorting of the global elites in very expensive neighborhoods and metropolitan areas making upward mobility difficult. Because the major urban centers have become so expensive Rajan focuses on place-based strategies as opposed to people-based strategies to uplift the left behind. He focuses on what he calls “inclusive localism.” By that he means that wealthy communities have to affirmatively loosen up their planning controls and society as a whole has to invest in infrastructure in poorer communities.However this is all too easy to say and very difficult to implement. Wealthy communities are not opening their doors and for poorer communities to uplift themselves there has to be a requisite amount of indigenous leadership ready and willing to take charge.My own view is that inclusive localism would be far easier to implement if we returned to the 100 year old ideology of the melting pot. I know this is not politically correct, but it largely worked for white America and probably can work for all of America today. If we are to have inclusive communities there is going to have to a lot give from all corners. It sort of comes down to that old saying of “think globally and act locally.” Further it would help if we had a program of national service where young people of different backgrounds are forced to work together on common goals and it would also help if the elite universities radically increased their class size to accommodate more students.Rajan closes the book with his global solution to today’s economic problems. To me that is a bridge too far and ought to be the subject of a different book.",4
"1789","Mama's Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What…","What animals feel","Angie Boyter","0393635066","R32ODFQ12WIZVO","1555434697","We humans like to think we are something special, that we have qualities no other animal possesses. Many people believe that our emotions are among the things that make us human. Primatologist Frans De Waal used to go along with this prevailing belief, but he has spent many years studying our closest relatives, and he says “More and more I believe that all the emotions we are familiar with can be found one way or another in all mammals, and that the variation is only in the details, elaborations, applications, and intensity.” In Mama’s Last Hug he makes his case for this position, and the result is both fascinating and convincing.De Waal says that modern emotion research puts too much stress on language, and that is part of the problem.  We humans don’t use language to recognize and respond to emotions of other humans in our daily lives; we observe; and DeWaal uses observation as his scientific tool to argue engagingly, but also convincingly, in favor of a rich emotional life for animals other than humans.He won me over  in Chapter 1  with a description of a moving reunion between Mama, a 59-year-old chimpanzee who was on her deathbed, and 80-year-old Jan van Hooff, who had been De Waal’s dissertation advisor and who had worked with Mama for many years. If you are skeptical of De Waal’s description, the reunion video is available on YouTube, and to me there is no doubt about Mama’s genuine joy at seeing her old friend.If DeWaal’s wonderful anecdotes do not convince you, consider his credentials. How often do you read a book by an IgNobel Prize winner? For those of you not familiar with the Ig Nobel prizes, they have been awarded annually since 1991 (on the Harvard campus but not by Harvard) to ""honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think.""  The paper that won the Ig Nobel for De Waal was called “Faces and Behinds”, and it was a study in which his team learned that apes have a “whole-body” image of familiar individuals and could even pick out individuals they knew from pictures of that ape’s derriere. My first reaction, of course, was to laugh, but then I had to recognize that this was clever work that tells me something rather impressive about apes.I had more laughs, some more sad moments, and a lot of thoughtful moments throughout the book.  Do read it; I am confident that you will come away with a greater feeling of kinship with all the creatures, great and small.",5

"1796","A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood: The Poetry…","Welcome to the neighborhood -- in book form","Sal Nudo","168369113X","R1I4NWFRJRMLD8","1555435026","I knew right away when I saw the cover of this hardcover book that it would be special. The cover illustration is brilliantly colorful and shows a gleeful Mr. Fred Rogers in all his glory with his famous puppet friends.Open the book and you'll find in the table of contents a listing of an astounding 75 songs in the form of poems. Several are singalong classics many of us know from Mr. Rogers' popular PBS show, but most were new to me.The majority of these poems get to the heart of who children are and what they feel, and they also gently teach. The simple advice resonates in the lyrics of poems such as ""Be the Best of Whatever You Are"" and ""I Like You as You Are."" The poem/song ""Children Can"" nails to a tee what it's like to be small. Other poems such as ""It's Good to Talk"" are encouraging and encourage introspection.There is lots of positivity and encouragement here. It makes you wonder why adults need therapy, drugs, or loads of self-help books to get by in life when they could simply listen to the words of Mr. Rogers. ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" takes me back to a more innocent time and makes me wish people in society were more like Fred Rogers.Simple. Fun. Honest. Beautiful. Bright. Those are some of the ways I would describe this book. ""You Are You"" shows that we are universal in the sense that we're all different. Occasionally there are poems that don't teach but are cheerful, fun, or goofy, ones such as ""Elephants,"" ""Summer Rain,"" ""It's an Ugly Day,"" and ""Walking Giraffe."" But mostly, these are poems that show children they are special and that they can dream and do.The writings are simple, often repetitive, and subtle in their teachings. It was fun to come across the several works that Rogers collaborated on with Josie Carey, who contributed as the lyricist, with Rogers handling the music. Her words were often a bit more complex and plentiful than Rogers', though not always. Their songs/poems together include ""Find a Star,"" ""Then Your Heart is Full of Love,"" ""Creation Duet,"" and ""I'm Tame.""It's not all rainbows, friendships, and balloons, however, as Rogers knew that kids go through tough things; some of his songs reflected that. He has a tender way of saying to them ""You can get through it."" I can envision children pondering the meaning of some of these words and looking inside themselves to search their feelings. A sense of realism often comes through in the lyrics, as shown in the poem ""Good People Sometimes do Bad Things.""And in some of these poems, I think Rogers is conveying what he's been through personally and how he feels and gets through difficult moments in life.I haven't said nearly enough about the brilliant drawings by Luke Flowers, whose illustrations are lively, colorful, and detailed. His images complement the work wonderfully and offer a modern bent to Rogers' timeless music.""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" ends as if rock stars are doing an encore: The last three songs/poems are ""I'm Proud of You,"" ""Tomorrow,"" and, what else, ""It's Such a Good Feeling.""If I had a newborn child, I'd buy him or her this book in a heartbeat. But you know what? As an oft-confused adult who sometimes gets it wrong, this book is still invaluable and inspirational.",5

"1809","Mama's Last Hug: Animal Emotions and What…","READ IT!","David Keymer","0393635066","R3137N4ZK1C5R4","1555435537","From his 1982 Chimpanzee Politics on, animal ethologist de Waal has explored and commented on the parallels  in human and animal (primarily simian) behavior.  This book is only the latest –the twelfth- in a long going dialogue, the last of which was 2016’s Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? This book  is thus about similarities between humans and animals, and the similarities are apparent and profuse. As De Waal notes repeatedly in this book,  why should we be surprised that Nature repeats itself? It is simpler to build modifications on a common platform and in most respects, there is little difference structurally or functionally between ape and human. But the book is also about emotions and the role they play in intelligence. If you have read the work of neuroscientist Antonio Damasio (whom De Waal cites), it won’t come as a surprise that emotions play a vital role in our decision making process. Block emotions and you can no longer decide anything. Emotions and intellect are a package in humans, not separated entities. And De Waal makes it clear that animals, not just humans, feel these motions. A good part of this book is an attack on the science-based bias that body is inferior to mind, and then, that animals are somehow distinct from humans in our essential functions--  they  don’t feel the emotions we do and thus we cannot apply to them labels like affection, grief, shame, guilt and envy.(De Waal has interesting comments on the significance of deny in social animals.) For De Waal, it is fairly simple: humans, simians, all the way down through colony fish, benefit more in the long run from cooperation than from out and our war, and thus we all have developed –evolved- ways to moderate our behavior in groups, and emotions are a key part of this: they give us advance but flexible signals (unlike rigid Skinnerian responses) to guide our choices in potentially fraught situations.As always, De Waal draws on hard and observational science both, and draws  acute and sensible from what he observes.",5

Even many of those I know who watched him were unaware that he had written the lyrics to songs performed on his show. This book has 75 of these poem/songs and it is one delightful book.Geared to children, it holds wisdom that many adults could benefit from. It's the kind of book that a child's parent, relative, godparent, grandparent, babysitter or nanny would enjoy, and learn from, while reading to a child.Within these various songs/poems, there is a great deal of ""guidance"" and inspiration about interacting with the world around us and learning how to BE and accept, and celebrate, one's self. These works are proof that you can, even from the youngest ages, create a positive environment of learning for a child. Feelings and emotions are dealt with in a way that, honestly, are as helpful to adults as any child. So many challenges we all face are dealt with in a straightforward way that belies the great heart and emotional intelligence behind the word.There is an honesty and a simplicity to the verses but also great depth--the sign of timeless literature, no matter its form.This is a book that should be read in daycare centers, in kindergarten, in any place where children are gathered.Reading this, as an adult, I find myself feeling uplifted and comforted. I can only imagine what a difference this could make in a child's life if it were read to them, if they were exposed to its kindness, compassion, acceptance for ourselves and others, as they grew up. It makes me wish I had had someone to read them to me. Luckily, as an adult, I can read them  myself.Among my favorites (that could be directed just as easily at adults) are:>Many Ways to Say I Love You>Sometimes Isn't Always>You've Got to Do It>The Truth Will Make Me FreeThis book is a joy and a delight.

Have you ever listened to the words of these songs, I mean, really listened?  Every one is written by Fred Rogers and they are beautiful, simple, and perfectly reflect values that so many of us want to convey to our children, but yet are so hard to find outside the home.

We have struggled with some of the songs and not knowing them, but online video sources have provided some assistance there in showing us how to sing them.  You can fudge your way through it, but how wonderful would it be if there was an accompanying CD.  It's still a great book, and there are enough songs here that you will never run out when it comes to singing at bedtime.  The one song my child loves the most by Mr Rogers is not listed, which is Goodnight God, and you can find that online with one search, and like most of his songs, it's easy to memorize.

Watching Neighborhood as an adult with my own children, I found I was constantly looking up the words to songs so I could sing them to my children at bedtime and this puts it all the best stuff in one place.  The illustrations are great for reading with children and combine the feel of the old show with a more modern art style.  I would have loved some photos in the mix from the actual set and an additional index that indicated which songs/rhymes/poems were from specific episodes of Neighborhood so that I could try and track down some of the more unexpected ones, and so that I could tell which ones were from a Neighborhood episode vs. which ones were just from his poetry.  BUT even without any of that, it's still a great collection to have.  It doesn't have every song from the show (my husband is a birder, so around our house we get a lot of kicks from singing the Mimus Polyglottos is My Pet and Troglodytes Aedon songs, but neither are in this collection) but it is a selection of some of the songs that address feelings, love, family and most of the songs that you'd hear somewhat regularly on the show.  I'm thrilled to have this in my collection and my kids love it too.  It's got a great bio for Mr. Rogers and is fittingly, 143 pages long.  Definitely made with love.",5

I Definitely watched Mr Rogers' Neighborhood as a child, but even so, there are many poems and lyrics here that are either new or forgotten. And all of them are wholesome, honest, and carefully worded in that special Mr Rogers way. They meet the child at their level, without talking down to them. Far from, the subject matter is sometimes pretty heavy, but never in a way that would depress or frighten a child.The illustrations are gorgeous, slightly cartoonish versions of Mr Rogers, his house, and the land of make believe, with it's cast of puppets. The overall design of this book is great. Just enough illustration to set the tone, and to keep pre-readers engaged as you read to them, without shifting focus away from the inspired and meaningful lyrics.There's a special nod to Mr. Rogers fans with page 143.Oh, and while these are all songs, they all work perfectly fine spoken, if you don't know the melody, or prefer not to sing!Solid recommend.",5

I laughed, I cried and laughed again. Incredibly informative , I ended up using an entire highlighter on this book (hence the highlighter color changes in video). It’s an absolutely fascinating view on human and animal emotions and the big question “do animals have feelings?”. My first thought whenever I hear someone ask that is: ‘they’ve never had a pet before’, as I think most of us dog (and/or cat) people have a hard time believing that anyone could believe animals don’t have feelings. But this delves deep into the difference between emotions and feelings and our tendency as humans to anthropomorphize. When your dog gives you a “guilty” look after peeing on the carpet is he feeling guilt or is he just sucking up because he knows you’re angry?  Why are humans the only animals to blush? Why do humans have a white sclera around their eyes when most mammals have little to no white in theirs? These are just a fraction of the fascinating questions that will be discussed in this awesome book on a subject we could all stand to learn more about. Who knows, maybe if we all read more books like this we would have more respect for other species (and perhaps even our own)!",5

All opinions are 100% my own and independent of receiving an advance copy.No matter what neighbourhood you live in, you are bound to have heard of Mr. Rogers. Fred Rogers was an incredible man, musician, puppeteer, writer, composer and children’s educator that was most famous for his television show Mister Rogers’ Neighbourhood. He revolutionized the way children’s shows reached children. He didn’t believe in turning into a different character but being realistic and speaking to children as your authentic self. He tackled many difficult subjects like racism, divorce and children with disabilities. He wrote hundreds of songs and created a whole land of make believe.This book takes the lyrics to many of his most recognizable songs and turns them into poems, with illustrations by Luke Flowers, reminding us of Mr. Rogers’ ability to find the beauty in the most simple things. At the back there is an index of subjects that the songs/poems deal with like manners, friendship, and positivity. Some of them are so familiar I could hear the tune as I read them. Others just take you back to feeling you had when you watched him. He was a friend, a confidant, someone who knew all sides of you, the silly side, the angry, sad, and happy side. This book will introduce him to a whole new audience. It’s a timeless keepsake that you could read to your children and your grandchildren.",5

I learned far more about Rose Wilder Lane than I ever expected for a book supposedly about her mother. Descriptions of Rose made me question just how often a person can be described as ""even more depressed.""

Ironically, the author focused a lot on the editorial relationship that Rose provided her mother yet seems to have written this book with little input from an editor. I question the editorial decision to use Wilder and Lane in place of Laura and Rose while needing to use first names for so many other characters.

It has compelling characters and a highly original setting that has strong metaphorical resonance as a monument to the dark history of America.  I feel like it's just a few clunky scenes away from the canon.  King spins off believable characters by the dozen, at least male ones.  Jack Torrance and Danny are memorable.  You can hate Jack and sympathize with him.  He is vain and given to rage, but has love for his family and interest in creating something significant.  There's real originality in how unlikable King allows Jack to be, because we're with him a long time.  Danny is very hard not to root for, but he isn't absolutely perfect.  If you can write children believably, it's always a win, and it is here.  It's not Sound and the Fury or Mary Cassatt, but still, the Compsons weren't psychic either.The Shining though, has a very nice touch that leverages the unique strengths of a book as a medium.  The power of the the child's ESP is to find words that are hiding in other people's minds.  It highlights how powerful words are as concepts and as mantras.  To a child who cannot read the words and does not yet know the concepts, they remain objects of interest and fear.  He can see how they are affecting the adults, but not exactly what they are.  He can see that they are real and potentially dangerous, but the nature of the danger is unknown.  That is masterful, terrifying, and as a literary gambit, it's top notch.  The only parallel I can think of is Nabokov in the last paragraph of the Vane Sisters or in Scrabble game in Ada.  However with the Nabokov, you get the feeling that creating a situation to play the word game was the reason for writing the work.  In the Shining, the word game moves the story forward and the builds understanding of the characters.The great scenes are well worth the time you spend in this.  The missteps and occasional cliche are of the time, and pretty forgivable if you're not complete snob.  I think this book will last, if it can't be considered to have done so already.  The Shining rises far above genre.  It frankly created one.",5

Cowen","0393635066","R3LCHZED44Y7UG","1555441777","A fascinating look at animal homologies for emotions like amusement, anger, disgust, love, sadness, and shame. Other animals laugh both when tickled and when engaged in more abstract play. They console victims. They play pranks. They grieve for the dead. What de Waal teaches us about animals gives us deep insight into our own emotions and those of our closest humans companions. Some have argued that emotions are psychologically constructed, suggesting that we can transcend our emotions merely by unlearning them. Not so. So many of the expressive behaviors that shape our daily social interactions, along with mass messaging, lie deep within our evolutionary roots. Acknowledging, rather than denying, the patterns of behavior that we share with our closest animal relatives is essential to structuring a society conducive to the better angels of our nature. Weaving together beautiful anecdotes with rigorous laboratory evidence, de Waal demonstrates that so much of what we think makes us special -- the good and the bad -- isn't really special to humans at all.",5

I didn’t care much for the movie bit, though.  If this was the way the protagonist related to the world, it got way too much attention.  The guy that lived as her tenant was an odd part of the novel.  His part never really went anywhere and their one-night stand didn’t seem to relate to anything.  A woman as sick as this character would most likely not want sex with a suspicious ex-prisoner.  Actually, I thought the protagonist sounded more male than female throughout the book.  In that event, even though very sick, he/she would want the sex!  The ending was not very good.  It was too contrived and there was way too much explanation from the murderer. It is not good to have to have all this explanation unless you are Agatha Christie.  I prefer light bulb type endings that really surprise you and you can understand for yourself.  Very few writers seem to be able to pull this off, nowadays.  The ending was not shocking or even a very good twist.  After all, it was raining and that was the only time something really happened in the book.  I vacillated between 3 and 4 stars because it did hold my interest although the writing was not great.

"1973","Save Me the Plums: My Gourmet Memoir","Marvelous addition to the food memoir canon","J. M. O'Connor","1400069998","R1IIB5FXU1HJ3C","1555447841","Ruth Reichl’s books are among my favorite food memoirs. I regularly give away copies of Tender At The Bone but Comfort Me With Apples and Garlic And Sapphires are right up there too. After finishing Garlic And Sapphires, which goes into her experiences as the New York Times food critic, I fervently hoped her next book would be about her time as the editor in chief at the now shuttered Gourmet magazine.

Save Me The Plums was worth the weight. Reichl gives a no-holds-barred account of her transition from food critic to EIC, her coworkers, the triumphs, and how it all came to an end. She was a very unconventional choice for EIC and we get to see very clearly how it played out. It made me a little bummed I never read Gourmet, at least not that I can recall. But given her account of what the magazine was like before she took over, I can understand why I would have written it off as “not for me” and never taken another look.

Reichl changed the culture of the staff and that in turn led to vibrant years together. I really enjoyed hearing about the risks they took, the way various people left their imprint on it, and the various writers they hired for articles, including David Foster Wallace. The behind-the-scenes on his piece Consider The Lobster was especially fascinating. She also admits where she messed up and what about the role worked for her and didn’t.

She also shares luminously about 9/11, both the personal impact and how the magazine staff came together to feed the rescue workers. It made me tear up, thinking back to where I was that fateful day and how we’ve changed as a nation since then.

Several recipes are included and I’ve bookmarked a few, including Spicy Chinese Noodles and Thanksgiving Turkey Chili. The love of food permeates the pages and while Reichl has a more adventurous palate than I do, she excels at making her readers love the journey as much as she did. Save Me The Plums is a marvelous addition to the food memoir canon.

I have never read a horror/ghost novel because frankly I get scared while watching reruns of Scooby Doo.  Yes, laugh all you want, but I know there are others out there who feel exactly the same way.  Now, knowing how much of a chicken I am, I suppose I can get in to my review of Steven King's The Shining.  For the record I had to read this book for a class and I would have never read it otherwise, but I actually began reading it and couldn't put it down.  King has created a spellbinding story of a family and a hotel.  The Torrence family, as dysfunctional as they may seem, became my tie to the novel.  I felt like I was in that hotel with them, like I was one of Jack and Wendy's children.  Their son, Danny, was however the creepy one to me.  I have always been afraid of books, movies, even cartoons, where there is a child who seems to be ""different"".  Danny definitely fits the mold of the creepy little kid.  He has a power, ""The Shine"", that allows him to read people's minds, predict the future, send messages to other people, even make things happen just by thinking about them. Also, Danny can see ghost. Yes, GHOSTS! He has a ""friend"" Tony who is a ghost. He shows Danny signs and other visual representations of either good or evil that is to come.  The sign that troubles Danny the most is ""Redrum""  So he learns to read so he can decipher what it means.The novel pits the family against their new home, a huge hotel that has a history  that is almost as unbelievable as the ghosts that haunt it.  The ""Overlook"" is a hotel where Jack Torrence and his wife and son will be living for the winter.  High atop a mountain in the Rocky Mountains the Overlook becomes very inaccessible during the winter months. Jack's job is to maintain the hotel during the ""off-season"" time.  Throughout their stay there, the history of the Overlook begins to be chipped away by Jack, who is a writer and uncovers a secret scrapbook in the basement.  This novel layers information upon information to leave the reader feeling submersed in the terror of the lives of the Torrences.  First we are faced with the drinking problem Jack has, along with the child abuse, and the loss of his job due to his beating of a high school student. You also must remember the jagged history of the Overlook, with the multiple murders and high profile owners/visitors it has housed throughout the years.  It could also be called the ""hotel of many secrets"".  Jack and his family are the ones who must uncover this past and in the process must face their pasts also. There are many thematic choices in this novel that I find very evocative and intriguing.  I am very impressed by Kings ability to transcend the conventions of the genre and make a riveting storyline that you will be immersed in.  This novel will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first page until you finish all 464 pages of horror. From the scary landscape of the Overlook, to the flashbacks of the past, to the ghoulish woman in room 217, you will be scared no matter how many horror novels you have read.  If you want to be truly scared, read ""The Shining."" Though frightening it is a fabulous book.",5

"1996","Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder","Fraser's political agenda blinds her","M Arneson","1627792767","R333X5RHNGRMYK","1555449241","This book ought to be really good. It’s well-researched; it’s about an interesting subject; Fraser obviously really admires Wilder and writes passionately about it. But the book suffers a major flaw that makes it ultimately a failure: Fraser’s political agenda intrudes time and again into the book and infects her judgments on both Laura Ingalls Wilder and her daughter Rose Wilder Lane. By the end of the book, it’s become an almost monomaniacal focus condemning Lane, even for petty things, and this feature is so distracting that it contaminates Fraser’s biographical judgment.

Fraser’s a liberal, who has no compunction about making statements such as “Socialism…helped” farmers on the 19th century frontier or portraying the New Deal solely in terms of compassion for the poor. That’s fine—she’s entitled to her political viewpoint. But it leads her into making omissions no competent historian would make, such as entirely ignoring the critique of the New Deal as a system of cartels for big business. This is a critique even liberals have acknowledged at least a little bit. The Progressive Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis agreed with it, striking down a major part of the New Deal in the 1936 Schechter Poultry case, for instance. But it appears nowhere in Fraser’s book.

That’s important because both Laura Wilder and Rose Lane were intense critics of the New Deal. Lane, particularly, is a major figure in the history of libertarianism. But Fraser never, in her 500+ pages, even attempts to address Lane’s substantive criticisms of the New Deal—even to refute them. Instead, she just asserts that “more discerning” people support government welfare—and she resolutely portrays Lane’s political views as a function of alleged mental illness. Thus we’re told that Lane wrote against the New Deal out of “a personal sense of grievance against the federal government,” or that she opposed FDR because “she found it easier to locate villains outside herself.”

This sort of psychologizing is simply infantile. No doubt Lane was a complex and cantankerous figure, perhaps even unlikeable. But to ascribe her political beliefs to that does a disservice not just to Lane, but to Wilder, who, after all, agreed with her daughter. Fraser recognizes this, so she is forced time and again to portray Wilder as having not REALLY believed in free markets and limited government, or of having somehow been duped by her daughter—which is a demeaning and fundamentally antifeminist perspective, not to mention flat-out wrong. Laura Wilder was no pushover. Fraser’s hostility to Lane transforms into misogyny, in fact; Lane was a remarkably modern figure—a world-traveling independent journalist who refused to compromise her career dreams to settle down to married life; she deserves recognition at least as one of the pioneering female intellectuals of the 20th century—yet Fraser manages to transform this into a character flaw that springs from Lane’s lack of a conscience and failure to act out stereotypically female versions of compassion. This, Fraser says, proves there was something wrong with her. No ’20s chauvinist could’ve said it better. (This is also false; Lane sponsored, at considerable personal expense, the educational and careers of several young people she “adopted” as her own. Fraser manages somehow to make this still more proof of her lack of charity.)

Fraser’s portrayal of opposition to the New Deal as a psychological disorder also does a disservice to those who believe the New Deal was a good idea. That’s because it’s not coupled with any substantive discussion or defense of the New Deal. That’s because it’s not coupled with any substantive discussion or defense of the New Deal. It makes no effort to address its merits, but rests upon an emotionalistic caricature of history, with good guy New Dealers against the Snidely Whipash capitalists. And that leads her into some real whoppers—such as when she quotes Rose Lane’s saying that “the laws of Nature and of Nature’s God endow you with a right to life and liberty”—and then calls this a “nationalistic” statement, which is simply the opposite of the correct adjective, whatever one’s own opinion might be. Or her statement that the 1930s was “a time of the most widespread food insecurity Americans had ever known.” Assuming “food insecurity” means anything, surely Americans in, say, 1863 or 1837 or 1873 or 1620 faced worse, no? Or her statement that the Nineteenth Amendment “was the most important advance in civil rights in America since Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.” So much for the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments and the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1875. She says that the Ingallses failed as homesteaders—a disputable claim—and then says their generation were essentially duped into homesteading because nobody could really have succeeded at it—also dubious—but then praises Progressive era banking laws that “would have provided a lifeline” to the Ingallses by giving them “low-interest loans”—after just telling us what terrible credit risks they were. And she even claims that “the Chicago tribune [in 1877] urged homeowners pestered by [the homeless] to spike handouts with ‘a little strychnine or arenic’ and poison men as if they were vermin.” This is just not true. That article was a satire. But because it supports her cartoonish sterotypes of the Gilded Age, she falls for a hoax.

As for historical issues of greater subtlety, they’re far beyond Fraser’s ken. She criticizes Lane for giving Mussolini and Hitler some measured approval in the 1920s and early 30s—ignoring the fact that many conservatives did so, including Winston Churchill. Hardly proof she was a fascist. She praises Laura Wilder for saying that “If I had been the Indians I would have scalped more white folks before I ever would have left [the prairie],” by saying that this “was a startling statement for a woman of her day.” It wasn’t. Such sentimentalism and romanticism—which was certainly well-grounded—was commonplace throughout Wilder’s lifetime and before; see the works of James Fenimore Cooper, for instance.

Her vendetta against Lane also blinds her to BIOGRAPHICAL issues of greater subtlety. Time and again she condemns Lane (and more gently, Wilder) for introducing false or inaccurate anecdotes into their writing—most notably the anecdote about Almanzo narrowly escaping the notorious Bender family of serial killers. But she never addresses the way in which people tell family stories over the years. Families tell stories back and forth over the years and often forget what actually did happen; they don’t always double check their records for factual accuracy. Over generations, these tales evolve and expand, and become treasured, so that they become “lore.” We’ve all seen this happen. Maybe Wilder and Lane knew that the Bender story wasn’t true, but it’s also possible that these tales were told back and forth for so long that they became lore, and they themselves didn’t know what was true or not. In the 1930s, Laura openly said it wasn’t true. But the 50s, did she even remember this? Maybe, maybe not—and Fraser makes no effort to address this. She simply takes the fact that it wasn’t true as proof of Rose’s dishonesty. (The fact that Laura also repeated the story? That’s just proof of Rose’s nefarious influence.)

This sort of sloppiness—even cattiness—ruins the book, which degenerates into a redundant, superficial, attack on Lane and on the libertarian political movement in general. That’s nothing new to libertarians, of course—always the red-headed stepchild—but it’s so poorly done that it not only fails to persuade, but it ends up as neither a satisfying biography nor a satisfying critique of the ideas. I mean, for example, on pages 498-99, she criticizes, of all things, Rose Wilder Lane’s GRAVESTONE—which includes a passage from Thomas Paine’s Agrarian Justice—for being written in all capital letters. Seriously, she calls this “shouting,” and then says that her dear friend who chose the words, Roger Lea MacBride, “and conservatives like him,” “had not read” Agrarian Justice, which, she says, was an argument in favor of a welfare state. Even putting aside the petty nastiness of such comments, and this dubious characterization of Agrarian Justice, and her misrepresentation of MacBride as a conservative, when he was actually a libertarian, what proof does Fraser have that MacBride and Lane didn’t read Agrarian Justice? She certainly doesn’t provide any.

This book features page after page of such millimeter-deep partisanship.

What it ultimately is, is a failure of imagination. Fraser just can’t CONCEIVE of how someone could have opposed the New Deal in the 30s, and thinks it must just prove that Rose hated poor people, was mentally ill, and didn’t know anything about history (and that she manipulated or brainwashed her otherwise independent-thinking mom). What it really proves is that Fraser doesn’t know, and doesn’t care to learn, about the context of the subject she’s writing about or to understand Laura Wilder or Rose Lane as they understood themselves. That’s a disservice to them and to the reader—and it’s a disappointment, because we all deserve better.",4

Drayson","150112644X","R1EF2NEK6ELLE","1555452686","I have read several books about Tiger; none which I liked. Until this one. It is extremely well researched and backed up by hundreds of footnotes. The authors are magnificent. This is a true PAGE-TURNER.
I t is well supported that Tiger’s father was an mean alcoholic abuser of everyone that he dealt with. HE WAS CLEARLY A THUG, stopping at nothing to acquire what he wanted, he was a lier and a thief. The manner in which he, Tiger’s mother and Tiger treated Nike representatives is the worst display of hatred I have ever learned of.
EARL WOODS can be accurately compared to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.
Tiger has clearly followed in his father’s footsteps. His adoration and hatred for his father is like nothing I have ever learned of; all supported by the author’s incredible research. With good reason Tiger never gave his father a graveyard headstone; had he it would have certainly been blown up with explosives.
Tiger’s treatment of all others he came in contact with is identical to his father’s teachings; hate, cheat, screw anyone, literally and figuratively, that he could.
Tiger WAS great golfer. Tiger IS a horrible human.
I'm so glad I read this book; congratulations to the authors on outstanding research.
Additionally, to the same extent that Earl Woods is a thief and a thug, his mother is a hateful which! How can anyone hate and ridicule Phil Michelson the way which Kultida does? Her bragging that she has NEVER forgiven anyone dictates that she does not belong in our society; national or international.

It is on a topic very familiar to me, as I consider myself a (not strict) minimalist. It would have been extremely helpful to me about two years ago!

If you want your clutter to stay the way it is, you may not enjoy this book! If you are already a minimalist, you have read most of these ideas before.To address the two criticisms of the Amazon reviews thus far:1) This is not a novel or structured like Ms. Rubin’s previous books. It is arranged so that one may read straight through (as I have done) or select pages to read here and there. The personal anecdotes so common in her “happier” books are not as pervasive here.2) It’s unfortunate that a few reviewers’ copies arrived dirty/damaged, but this is not a true criticism of the book.

While the book is structured around Gretchen Rubin’s five steps for decluttering and organizing, each page is a stand-alone, smart little tip.  (Yeah, I absolutely should have “donated quickly” back in January rather than moving my giveaway pile into the basement!)""Outer Order, Inner Calm"" is motivating because it’s realistic.  For example, using the methods in ""Outer Order,"" you can make some improvements to better your home even if you don’t have a lot of time.  Also, the cleaning methods and checklists don’t rely on convincing your partner or family to “do their part.”I love that ""Outer Order, Inner Calm"" proposes long-term habit changes to maintain order, such as strategic shopping, repairing broken items, and adding beauty to your home.  ""Outer Order"" also addresses work-life in addition to home-life (because work is a part of life!)If you’re interested in the KonMari method, ""Outer Order, Inner Calm"" is a great companion book.  Both Marie Kondo and Gretchen Rubin agree that the ultimate goal is happiness!  Personally, I like Marie Kondo’s “spark joy” concept, but I feel like part of the instructions are missing.  (The KonMari method seems to be easier to implement on ""Tidying Up,"" where the families can ask Marie Kondo questions to fill in the blanks!)  ""Outer Order, Inner Calm"" diagnoses many of my ongoing clutter problems and gives concrete solutions.  That pile of “not clean, but not dirty” clothes on the bedroom chair – put up a hook!I’d recommend ""Outer Order, Inner Calm"" to you if you like Marie Kondo but need more concrete and varied ideas on how to declutter, if other people rely on you to keep your home organized, if you want to declutter efficiently, or if you’re the type of person who needs an individual cleaning method.",5

This is one frustrating book to read because the author is such a poor writer and has no idea how to pull together a narrative storyline without going off on tangents or including her speculative opinions on virtually every page. The facts are here, but pulling together lots of printed information from 150 years ago does not a good story make. Instead the reader is forced to read over and over ""perhaps,"" ""maybe,"" ""could have,"" ""must have,"" ""probably,"" ""possibly,"" etc. So the writer is making up stuff as she goes along, trying to attribute characteristics to the Ingalls characters where there is no support for it.

The author also takes dramatic political stances that are inappropriate for this book. She uses early pages to try to condemn the movement of Indians out of Minnesota, failing to show any concern for the fact that hundreds of citizens of the new state were executed by Native Americans that refused to honor treaties. Certainly Indians were not treated well, but to use these bloated pages to preach that the settlers were the bad guys whose deaths seemed somehow justified is inexcusable.

This rambling text also lacks maps, charts, timelines, and other graphics that would have helped in the telling of the story. Because the writer insists on tossing in just about every minute detail that she found searching through historical records (including Ingalls that she's not sure are even related to Wilder!), the presentation of just words on a page make for tedious reading in spots and illustrations would have made stronger points.

Bottom line is that this person can't write well. Almost every sentence is clunky in a formal structure that seems outdated. She sounds like she's writing something from 150 years ago, and maybe that was the intent to match the tone of the Little House books. But if it was it's a mistake. At over 500 pages it's way too long with plenty of unnecessary historical information that has little to do with the Ingalls saga or that could be summarized in a paragraph instead of a chapter. The author's bias (working for the company that publishes the Little House books) hurts and an objective view of the material would have improved the content. It's hard to believe this book won awards because the well-written book about Wilder has yet to be written.",4

"2118","A Gentleman in Moscow: A Novel","Extremely long book and although informative and descriptive, felt a bit exhaustive for my liking","D.P. McHenry","0143110438","R2J79SQE57WSC1","1555459102","My gf's and I decided to read this book for our book club and although I'm sure I will get a lot of backlash for this, we were not huge fans. I will admit, maybe the audience he was writing for was an older generation and maybe we were too young to really get it, that's fine. No author can appeal to everyone, but I am entitled to my opinion, so here goes...

I I'll start with the positives...the book was extremely descriptive and paints an excellent picture of what life was like for Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov forced to live in a hotel in Moscow for his entire life. Furthermore, the book it a bit of a history lesson and it was interesting to learn about what life was like in Moscow from the 1920s and onward. It was also written very well, and I felt more intelligent after reading it. It's written for a more educated and cultured reader, that's a definite. There's also a lot of lessons to be learned throughout the book from humility, compassion, endurance, self sacrifice, loyalty, and of course the power of love. I feel like many 'millennials' need to be taught some of these things! (Note, I myself am a millennial!)

On the other side, my goodness was this book long, 465 pages...I felt like it could have easily ended in under 350. I personally felt like the book really didn't get going until the little girl appeared, then things started getting interesting, and dramatic. Before then, it was very descriptive and yes, it painted a great picture of the count and all the other characters, the hotel, Moscow itself, why the count was there to begin with etc., but I found my mind drifting numerous times throughout all this. I had to put the book down numerous times. Lastly, some people loved the ending...I wasn't a huge fan. I felt I like I had climbed up a large mountain, spent hours upon hours hiking and came to a highway at the end of my hike, instead of a gorgeous view. Others may think differently, but I wasn't impressed!

I gather they will make this into a movie soon and I am interested to see how the movie will pan out and how well it will compare to the book. I would also love to see who would play the characters in the book.

Overall, I would give it a 3.5 out of 5...",5

Reading this book made me feel human and normal which is a good thing when it comes to something as draining and overwhelming as dealing with your life long acquired possessions. Sound, wise, practical advice this book even had me laughing out loud at some points.Highlights for me:The author points out that organizing is not the first step to creating outer order, getting rid of things is the first step. I like that the book starts out explaining that you have to ""make choices"" essentially what to keep and where to put it. I can be very indecisive at times so the fact that she points out that you need to make decisions is very logical and useful to me.The book lists questions to ask yourself to help make those choices and decisions easier.  Every item in your home or your space started out as a decision, in many cases a choice to buy or not to buy, as a person who shops too much this really spoke to me.The book is funny and really gets to the heart of human nature of how we often tie our emotions to our possessions even when it doesn't serve our best interests to do so. I laughed when she pointed out that you don't need ""two sifters"" I currently own two and that if you make your coffee in a Keurig then you don't need the French press (I currently own both AND an espresso machine.)Her ideas are concrete ""if you can't retrieve it you won't use it"" (espresso maker on the high top shelf that took up too much counter space).  ""Use it up, wear it out, make it work or do without""This book is easy to read, it's fun, its thought provoking and it gives you the green light to let go of guilt (which is a huge reason I personally feel obligated to keep things I never use.) I really have a deeper understanding as to why some items have been so difficult for me to let go of.I have read “ The Magic Art of Tidying Up” and I loved the concept “does it spark joy?” But found many of the other concepts overwhelming and strict and when I was incapable of implementing them perfectly I felt as though I had failed, feeling defeated I quickly gave up.In Outer Order Inner Calm “ There are no magic, one-size-fits-all solutions for establishing order; we all need to do it in the way that’s right for us.” This freed me from the guilt and fear of imperfection and is the exact type of encouragement that someone like me (who fears failure) needs to finally tackle my clutter.

You can read it and start decluttering in 30-45 Minutes.Negative: It reads a little bit like a sticky note collection or a power point presentation turned into a book.Inside the five main chapters, there is basically no order - they seem to look like a collection of random keywords.

A number of the jokes, while corny as expected, referenced things so far in the past it would be beyond understanding to the child reading it or even their parents such as the funky chicken or air mail; or subjects even an older kid wouldn't be able to relate to, like the appellate court.

CRADDOCK","198211598X","R3SJ5Q159D8UCM","1555465375","I always thought that Stephen King was a hack and recoiled in horror when his fans compared him to Poe and said one day he would be studied as a great writer of Literature.  Though that is never going to happen, King is nevertheless a great writer, a superb craftsman, and both Stephen King books I read were really good. The other book I read was called On Writing, and it is a sort of mini autobiography, memoir, and also a how to manual ""on writing."" I didn't always agree with his advice, but if you read the book, and don't try to condense things down to a few rules and aphorisms, he always allows for exceptions to every rule. Anyway, while he is writing mostly in the horror genre, that doesn't mean he neglects or ignores great Literature. In fact he says that it is essential to not only write every day, but to read as well. He reads 70 to 80 books per year, and there are all kinds of Literary allusions that he will drop in. The Shining was an excellent opportunity for him to do so, for the main character was a writer, in fact, a lot of the plot is driven by Jack Torrance's Writer's Block. As for Poe, there are parallels drawn with The Masque of Red Death and The Fall of the House of Usher.The movie is also really great, directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. The book and the movie are slightly different, but each is really great in its own way. But I digress. We are talking about the book here, and the fact that I have heretofore refused to read any books by Stephen King because I am such a Literary Snob, but now that I have read two King books, I discovered that he is a really a good writer after all. He spins a good yarn, and really knows how to create suspense. You find it is impossible to put down. The pages start turning themselves, as if they are are also haunted by the malevolent spirits of the Overlook Hotel. For instance, his son Daniel seems to possess second sight--the shining, that gives the book its title. Daniel has an imaginary friend named Tony, and after a series of paranormal experiences they take him to see a doctor. The doctor is skeptical of paranormal phenomena, but he is enough of a psychologist to note the significance of the name, ""Tony."" But what? I was wondering the same thing. King teases you with revelations of this sort. He piques your curiosity. As Jack Torrance says, ""Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought him back."" In his book On Writing he describes the story as an object that is being excavated, like an archeological relic. Still, Theme, Symbols, Jungian Archetypes, are often buried along with the story, and if you find such pearls and jewels, it would behoove you to polish them, and offer them in a splendid setting so they shine their brightest. A symbol that really shone for me in The Shining was the wasp nest. Later, during the climactic scenes, the snowmobiles racing to the Overlook were wasp-like, and oh, watch out for others, don't want to spoil the surprise, don't want to take out the sting. So, what was the significance of Danny's imaginary friend being named ""Tony?"" I am sworn to secrecy. You are just going to have to read the book.Redrum!",5

For years when I was a kid I read the ""Little House"" book series every single year. I'm fascinated by Laura and her experience so the beginning of the book where the author discusses Laura is what got and kept my interest. Then, about 1/2 way through, the book turns to Rose, Laura's daughter. While I understand that Rose played a huge part in getting Laura writing books, editing for her mother, etc.... I really was not interested in a blow by blow description of Rose's life. I felt like Rose's story should have been second to Laura's while still explaining the huge role she played.

I kept reading but eventually got tired of Rose so I skimmed the rest for parts that included Laura. How Laura ended up with such an awful daughter would have been interesting to find out...",4

Chills.Jack Torrance is a husband and father.  After being fired from his job as a teacher, he accepts a caretaker position at the Overlook Hotel.  He and his family will watch out for the place during the off-season.  Because of the winter weather, they know that they may be stranded there for weeks at a time.  This will give them all a chance to be together and also allow Jack to write the next great novel.  The hotel and its' permanent inhabitants have a different idea.The Shining is a frightening book.  Yes, it's scary because of all the paranormal things that happen with the hotel's ghosts.  More than that, it's scary because of Jack.  He wants to be a good man, husband, father, writer, etc.  But, you see, Jack has some anger management issues.  He was fired from his job as a teacher because of an altercation with a student.  He broke his son's arm in anger.  Jack is `ripe for the picking' as the one to do the dirty work for the ghosts.The Shining is also sad.  You could feel Jack's struggle.  He doesn't want to hurt anyone but his demons won't allow him to live a normal life.  One of his demons is alcohol.  Most of us know someone who is a different person when drinking.  Jack is that person.Danny, Jack's son, has some special powers.  He has ""the shining"" or ability to talk with others with his mind.  He can also see what others are thinking and in some cases, what is about to happen.Wendy is Danny's mother and turns out to be one tough mother!  I much prefered her in the book versus the movie.Almost every other character is compelling - Mr. Ullman, Hallorann and so on.The Shining is a favorite and 5/5 stars.

Like others, I find the plethora of information about Rose to be dry and not especially illuminating. Historical books about LIW suffer from the fact that there are not many extant sources about Laura, Almanzo, Pa, Ma, Mary, Carrie, and Grace. Many (most?) of the letters that the family wrote after Laura left Dakota Territory were not saved which is a loss for all of us. Rose, on the other hand, was in public life for a large part of her life. The letters that she and Laura wrote back and forth were preserved. There is a great deal of fodder for historians to regurgitate regarding Rose. Therefore, that is what we get. We get more than enough to know that Rose was not a very nice person, and she may not have been very honest, either.

Nonetheless, the portion of the book that explains how, as settlers on the frontier, Pa and family made choices and lived with the consequences is well worth the time it takes to read and absorb it. Highly recommended!",4
"2316","A Visual Theology Guide to the Bible: Seeing and Knowing God's Word","Pretty, but ...","Chris Brooks","310577969","RZQQ6W62KZK8C","1555473661","This book is visual. It has a lot of pretty images. But what quality? To answer that, I'll ask what I expect will be common questions.Are the pictures different from what you'd find in other books? Largely, yes. Not all of them are terribly original, but the majority of them are.Is meaning of the visuals clear? Mostly. A few of them are pretty opaque, but they're a small percentage.Are the images useful apart from the text? Some of them. Some could be ripped out of the book and used as posters. Some are only clear in conjunction with the text. Some aren't clear even with the text. Some seem to have no bearing on the text.Do the pictures convey information better than text would? Most of them, no. Some of them so-so. A few of them very much so. The latter is what I wanted in this book. Sadly, it's only a handful of the visuals. Out of 200 pages, I find 9 graphics I can see myself using to teach this material.What about the text itself? It's pretty brief. They try to cover a lot of material in a very short amount of time and don't manage to accomplish a lot. For example, the section on the formation of the NT canon uses few words and a few unexplained images that end up defeating their purpose. Another example is the section on how to study the Bible -- it's too brief, though their visual on application is going on my wall.My verdict is that this book could be a tool to teach the material, but it's not something I could just hand to someone. It has a few fantastic graphics, a few good ones, and quite a few meh ones. So is it worth the money? I guess it depends on what you want it for. If you want to hand it to a student, no. If you want to cut it up and use certain pages as visual aids, maybe. If you want pretty images, maybe something to give you ideas of what you might do yourself, yes.This is a new style of book trying to reach the next generation by speaking their language, and for that the authors should. be commended, but in the end I think they put the visuals over the message.",3

"2323","American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space Race","Going to Moon Was Hard; Reading American Moonshot is Easy","M. Bailey","006265506X","R21GQT1YAWMQVM","1555474464","The Space Age has also been the Television Age, so, of course, John F. Kennedy met Wernher von Braun late in 1953 in the Pathe’ Studios green room (or whatever they called it then) in New York. Kennedy was freshman senator and von Braun was running the Army’s rocket program. Kennedy told von Braun how his brother had been killed in an operation related to the German V-weapons and the two discussed the new challenge from the Soviets and importance of ballistic missiles. They would remain friends for the rest of Kennedy’s life, although von Braun would beat Kennedy to national television renown with his appearances on the “Disneyland” series about space travel.

And that casual meeting would put the United States on a course to the moon.

Douglas Brinkley’s “American Moonshot: John F. Kennedy and the Great Space Race” does for Kennedy and the space program what he did with Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt the environment. The progress of rocketry parallels with Kennedy’s career until they would interact so fatefully in 1961.

Brinkley’s thesis is that the moon landing would have taken place much later without Kennedy’s determination to set a “hard” goal and carry it through. After the initial cheering for a moon landing “before this decade is out,” Congress began to waver. Ike came out of retirement to oppose Apollo and Goldwater wanted the Air Force take over space operations. LBJ was always strong for manned space flight, but perhaps not willing to go quite as boldly as Kennedy (he would as faithfully carry on Kennedy’s Apollo legacy as he did his civil rights legacy).

Even those familiar with Kennedy and Apollo will find fresh threads in “Moonshot.” While still in the Navy, Kennedy took private flying lessons. Then there’s the expression “Moonshot” itself, which was coined by Dodger announcer Vin Scully to describe not very deep fly balls hit by Wally Moon that nevertheless cleared the forty-foot high screen the Dodgers put up to prevent cheap shot home runs in the L. A. Coliseum, where the left field stands were only 250 feet down the line.

Kennedy’s interest in space flight grew as the program developed. John Glenn went on beyond the schedule as Kennedy kept asking questions, so he offered to come back with models to help explain in more detail. The meeting was scheduled at once and he would not only return with the models, but also get an invite to the famous dinner for Nobel Prize winners (one of the few details Brinkley leaves out). He became a virtual member of the Kennedy family to the point of being asked by Ethel Kennedy to comfort the children back in Virginia when Bobby was shot in California. When they hit off immediately, Alan Shepard became another Kennedy favorite.

The much cited Rice University speech (“we choose to go to the moon and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard”), now perhaps as familiar as the Inaugural (or indeed any bit of public rhetoric since World War II), marked the culmination of multi-day tour of NASA facilities across the South. At every stop, Kennedy asked question after question, overstayed the schedule, delighted in the technology and, in the case of von Braun, talked him into continuing the conversation on Air Force One, en route to Florida and a visit to Cape Canaveral.

Kennedy saw the space program as both an adventure producing heroes to be admired – the astronauts were his kind of guys – and a way to jump start American technology for the latter half of the 20th Century. And incidentally, bring high tech to parts of the Southeast. By the fall of 1963, Apollo was well on its way. Kennedy would look over the Gemini craft under development in St. Louis, see the firing of an early version of the Saturn engine and check out the Manned Spaceflight Center in Houston. There he got into a long conversation with Gordon Cooper and invited him to accompany him to his next stop. Cooper had to beg off – he was participating in an important, long-scheduled test the next day.

So Kennedy went to Dallas without him.",5

I’d been having a good chat with myself for several months by the time I received an ARC of I Miss You When I Blink, a family meeting if you will- albeit with only one family member in attendance.

Without going into too many details, I’d been working a job that I loved more than anything, until I didn’t. Things changed and they changed quickly. I knew about two days into the school year that it was time to move on.

""You can stand by your past decisions even if they took you to a present where you don’t belong anymore.""

Yes, yes, yes! I felt so full of gratitude for the events, people, and situations that crossed my path and changed me, but it was long past time to hike a different trail- perhaps a moderately rugged one this time, preferably near a lake, yoga studio, or independent bookstore…

I started applying for jobs, filling in general applications so that when hiring season came upon me, I could click on specific positions and hit “submit”. Then I received a phone call. The principal and I spoke on the phone for well over thirty minutes, both driving home from work, and I knew that she was the person I wanted to work for. She offered to meet over coffee. I turned her down. I couldn’t leave mid year.

In the words of Mary Laura, “This is the book when you’re feeling like, ‘What the hell am I going to do with my life?’ and you need to know you’re not alone.” A memoir in essays, Mary Laura will inspire you to get on that elliptical machine, look at where you came from, see how you’ve outgrown your current situation, and kick some serious ass in the next big adventure!

""But our lives aren’t one suspended moment, a single either-or choice; they’re a string of moments, a string of choices.""

A month later, I emailed the principal and asked if the position was still available. I interviewed, I met with the superintendent. Seven days after turning in my letter of resignation I found myself in another state, lounging by a hotel pool, because my apartment wasn’t available yet and there was a snow day on my first day of school.

The book is Jenny Lawson meets Brene Brown- only WAY better! It’s one of the few that made me actually laugh out loud, but it also made me cry. It’s about being real and vulnerable. You can be some fancy pants lady getting paid to read books in your beautiful home wearing cozy socks designed for running that actually do quite well for sitting, but you also have to deal with medical scares, job loss, bills, and turtles knocking on your door. Life is work for everybody and “Nobody’s path is as linear as it looks in retrospect.”

I drafted this blog post months ago never anticipating that I would be working my dream job while living walking distance from Lake Michigan, a five minute drive to a yoga studio, and within 30 minutes of an independent bookstore that doubles as a live music venue, coffee shop, and wine bar. Best of all, I’m near family. My soul has always been in Michigan and it feels so good to be home.

Please read this, or… better yet- let’s read it together with brie salad sandwiches, carrot cake, and wine!",5

For over ten years from 1974 to 1986, a sadistic predator roamed the night committing approximately fifty sexual assaults in Northern California and ten murders in Southern California.

I could NOT put this book down, finished it in one day, stayed up til 1 a.m.. Shades of Fleetwood Mac and perhaps the Eagles, great scenes of what goes on behind the scenes. I thought the format would bother me, but I actually enjoyed it - interviews of the key ""players"" and their perceptions of events. I wasn't a huge fan of Daisy; in the beginning, she seems as if she can do no wrong, and is working the silver spoon. But she becomes more human as the story unfolds. Is she Stevie Nicks? Is she Sheryl Crow? Now that I think of it, I wasn't very fond of Karen, either. Perhaps the only sympathetic female character is Camila - I found her real and amazing. Warren is hilarious, Billy is noble, Eddie has a huge chip on his shoulder. Jenkins-Reed seems to know a lot about the recording industry, and the song lyrics at the end are a special bonus, as is discovering where each of the characters go after walking away, not always wilingly, from the success. I look forward to Amazon's treatment of the story.P.S. Thanks to NetGalley for the ARC.",4

"2452","When We Left Cuba","Completely captivating!","Rachel M","045149086X","R3MLKRMQFZTBDP","1555482363","This was such a wonderful story! I really enjoyed Chanel Cleeton's Next Year in Havana so I was really excited to learn that one of my favorite characters in that book would get to tell her own story. This is that story. The events in this book take place after those in Next Year in Havana and while I enjoyed seeing all of the characters again, this story stands on its own. I was hooked by this story from the very beginning and had a fantastic time with this book.

This is really a big story. Beatriz and her family are living in Florida after fleeing Cuba when Castro came into power. The family has suffered a lot of losses and it has been a difficult adjustment. Beatriz and her family hope to go back to Cuba but are also trying to make a life in Florida. Beatriz's mother would like to see all of her daughters married but Beatriz has other ideas. She has turned down quite a few marriage proposals and is more focused on revenge.

This story was filled with excitement. Beatriz works with the CIA and let's just say that her life is far from boring. She was passionate about the cause that she was working towards and it was really quite interesting to see her in action. Some of her missions were more exciting than others but it was great to see her in action.

I was really taken by the romance in this story. It was not your average romance and I am actually somewhat surprised that I was so taken with it but I just found myself swept away by their chemistry. Nick and Beatriz were just great together. They were incredibly attracted to each other and couldn't seem to stay apart even when they tried. There were so many things that seemed to work against the possibility of a relationship between them but they just couldn't stay away from each other. There were things about their relationship that made me sad and I wouldn't necessarily say everything turns out well but I think they were both better for knowing each other.

I really enjoyed the politics and history that were a part of this book. This was such an eventful period of time and I loved seeing some of the events that I have learned about worked into this story. I thought that all of the little details that the author included really added to the authenticity of the story.

I would highly recommend this book to others. This was a captivating story about a passionate character working to make a difference in the world while trying to find some happiness for herself. I cannot wait to read more from this talented author.

I received a digital review copy of this book from Berkley Publishing Group via NetGalley.",5

"2484","The Way of the Warrior: An Ancient Path to Inner Peace","Contains some theological issues","Joan N.","1601429568","R2O1JG01QBWT46","1555484799","I like the way the book started out. There is something wrong with the world. We long for world peace but the only way that will happen is when there is peace within. That peace will not come without a struggle. McManus says his book is about that journey.He writes about being a warrior in that struggle and then goes on at length about the way of the warrior. Warriors can be competitive yet still have humility and be selfless. A warrior can be both great and a servant. The warrior owns his defeat. The warrior knows what feeds his soul.I felt McManus lost the focus of inner peace. Don't believers have the peace of God that passes all understanding? (Phil. 4:7) Why didn't McManus write anything about the peace that comes from God? “Peace can come only when it is fought for,” McManus writes. (3) Yet Paul promised in Phil. 4:6-7 if we let our requests be made known to God by prayer with supplication and thanksgiving, the peace of God would guard our hearts. Paul also said in Rom. 5:1 if we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God. Paul also said in Rom. 8:6 to set the mind on the Spirit is peace. Why would we have to fight for peace when the Bible is clear on how to have it?McManus certainly has a way with words. “The warrior knows their strength only when standing in their weakness.” (129) His writing is entertaining and captivating. He tells good stories. He makes grand statements: “The warrior trains their mind to know the good and beautiful and true.” (92) But he never gives us the nuts and bolts of how to do the grand things he writes about. There is no practical strategy given nor specific actions to take. How do we war for that inner peace?There is also a bit of concern about the theology included in the book. McManus writes, “The future is not determined; it is created.” (93) There are many problems with a statement like that, the primary of which is God and prophecy. If the future is not determined, then what in the world is prophecy? It is God who “works all things” to the desired end, not we who create the future. He also writes, “The warrior becomes one with all things.” (157) “The warrior is one with all things.” (195) Connected to God, others, and things? Yes. But one with all things? No. I think those of an eastern religion would be more comfortable with McManus' statements.A glaring theological omission by McManus shows up when he writes about some people thinking the universe is against them. (161) He says “the universe is for you … because God is for you.” (162) The novelist Paulo Coelho “is not wrong,” McManus writes, in describing the entire universe as conspiring “on our behalf.” (171) McManus never mentions Satan, demons, evil, spiritual warfare, etc.Men might like this book. It would allow them to think of themselves as warriors with the single intention of winning the battle raging within. (197) But there are no specific nor practical actions suggested in the book so they would not have to face the reality of actually doing anything to win the battle. They would not have to think about accepting Jesus as Savior nor participating in spiritual warfare nor allowing the Holy Spirit to actually transform their character. (McManus does write of “becoming one with Christ” but does not mention sin, forgiveness, salvation, etc. (184))I received a complimentary ARC of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review.",2

Taking her cue from the very successful and very well-written “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, Ms. Rubin came out with her own version (mediocre at that).  This would all be fine if the books were well written and properly researched.  Unfortunately they are neither.  Ms. Rubin’s books read more like an elaborate blog than a thoroughly researched topic.  This was the same problem with her last book.  Instead of doing due diligence, Ms. Rubin takes a casual approach and bases her conclusions on personal observations rather than research.  It’s disappointing that most of her ideas come from riding the tailcoats of other previously published successful authors.  Perhaps she should confine her musings to her blog.  Imitation isn't always a form of flattery.",1

"2498","Lies My Doctor Told Me Second Edition: Medical…","If you want to take charge of your own health, THIS is the book to read!","Barbara Wood","162860378X","R1LYLU4PBYZ0K2","1555485926","Let me preface this review by saying I don't recall writing a review on many products, much less a book since I order many. However, I could not pass up the chance to let people know of the value of Dr. Berry's insight into the world of conventional medicine.I am a 70 year old female who worked for a large healthcare system for almost 20 years.  Because my interests had always been in the medical field I took courses of study in college for pre-med and surgical technology.  And, I still have most of those books.About 17 years ago my husband and I knew we needed to lose weight so we joined a 9 week class promoting a vegan lifestyle.  We followed this diet and lost a ton of weight and felt better than we had in years.  Of course, we were eating no dairy, no sugar, no processed foods, plus no meat or animal products.  We did enjoy looking better and feeling better, BUT it is a very difficult way of eating for people on the go, which we were pretty much all the time.  Needless to say over a period of time, we got tired of juicing and all we had to do to continue that lifestyle.Fast forward to now.  Little by little over time we introduced sugar, breads, pasta, etc. back into our diet and as you can imagine, the weight piled back on.  I found myself at my highest weight ever and over a year ago had developed a nagging cough.  At my yearly checkup with my doctor in January of this year he suggested I increase my acid reflux meds and lose 15 lbs since his diagnosis was that my cough was due to my acid reflux.  So, as much as I wanted to get rid of this nagging cough I gained another 7-8 lbs. instead of losing.  At this point I not only could not fit in my clothes, but I was beginning to feel really bad.  My house has a lot of stairs wherever you look and they were even becoming a challenge.Because my family is riddled with heart disease and diabetes I finally decided it was time for a major change.  Many of my high school classmates had already passed away and I did not want to be added to that list.  So, the internet search for a way to lose all this added weight was on.  I was seeing more and more about the Keto diet but I wasn't interested since it seemed too close to the Atkins diet.  I had done that one years ago and lost 20 lbs fairly easily, but I was never convinced it was healthy.  So, Keto seemed to fly in the face of everything I had learned working in the medical field.In my search I ran across this physician by the name of Ken Berry, who surprisingly has his practice less than an hour from my house.  The title of his book intrigued me.  It was only $10.00 and I easily spend that on a meal so I thought it might be interesting.  Interesting would be an understatement.  I absolutely could not put it down.  Even with other responsibilities I had, I read it in two days and even that was with me re-reading portions just to make sure I was understanding what he was saying.We have, over the past two weeks, been slowly adapting to a new way of eating and the results are amazing already.  I am excited about our weight loss, but more importantly, I'm convinced our overall health will GREATLY benefit.  This book is obviously very easy to read, easy to understand regarding how our bodies work, and is filled with suggestions for added research.  Let's face it; it's time we ALL took charge of our own health.  You will NOT regret purchasing this book and you'll probably keep it on your nightstand like I do for a ready reference.I look forward to our friends and family looking at us and asking what in the world we did to get so slim and healthy.  That's when I'll be buying more of Dr. Berry's book to share with them.  Get this book! You'll be so glad you did.",5
"2499","Outer Order, Inner Calm: Declutter and Organize…","Excellent discussion of decluttering, but not much on inner calm","naturalmama","1984822802","R1Z7MG28AZ4LUG","1555485966","I really enjoyed this book. The format, which some reviewers disliked, was actually my favorite part. This is a quick read, and she provides lots of options for clearing the various spaces of your office, home, etc., and you're free to pick and choose whatever methods speak to you. I also liked the layout of the book (even on a Kindle Paperwhite), the graphics, and the use of white space.Having gone through a massive decluttering effort several years ago and being a huge fan of a capsule wardrobe, many of the concepts in this book were familiar to me, but there were also plenty of new suggestions. I've read a lot of decluttering books, and this one is a great alternative to specific methodologies put forward by some authors. There's no advice about clearing one room at a time or using some kind of question framework to assess every possession, but there are lots and lots of different approaches, and you're bound to find something that works for you.That said, I felt like this book was heavy on the outer order but light on the inner calm. I didn't see anything backing up the claim that clearing your space changes your emotional state. I was expecting to see something about the link between clutter and depression/anxiety, but there wasn't even a chapter devoted to this topic. It seems odd to me to call a book Outer Order, Inner Calm and then not discuss how the two are linked. I took off one star for this.Overall, I liked this book and think it would make a great gift for someone new to decluttering, but even those of us who are already experienced declutterers or minimialists can find some new wisdom here.",4

I read in an interview somewhere that Rubin has admired Food Rules by Michael Pollan, which is a short, simple, boiled down compilation of smart food advice that is often self-evident. Outer Order, Inner Calm does have a similar vibe. WHAT IT IS: This is a book with many small nuggets of clutter clearing wisdom, some of which may give you an ""a-ha!"" moment and make it much easier for you to clutter-bust. There are lots of questions in this book that will help you decide what to keep and what's clutter, as well as interesting strategies for tackling clutter. WHAT IT IS NOT: This is NOT a detailed guide for clearing clutter from each room in your house. There's no chapter called ""garage"" with micro-managing tips on where or whether to store your gardening equipment. If you want a detailed process to walk you through each room in your home and identify the top clutter issues in each room and guide you through step-by-step... this is not that book. BUT THIS BOOK IS GREAT: This book is filled with simply stated common sense. No need to weed through overly long anecdotes to get a small pearl of wisdom, Rubin has searched for all the pearls in the ocean of de-cluttering wisdom and strung them on a necklace for you which you can read in an afternoon. It's very likely that there are at least a few incredible ideas in here that will be new to you and useful to you.",4

Unfortunately, as someone who likes Gretchen and her podcast, it was very disappointing. I was already familiar with many of the things and even the stories in the book. Maybe I’m being unreasonable but I was expecting some additional value considering how aggressively she’s been promoting it to listeners who already knew these thoughts. As another reviewer said, I felt that she got me. I also understand why another reviewer returned her audio book. We were trusting that she would deliver. Unfortunately this is not a book that I’d recommend to anyone who follows Gretchen.On the other hand, if you don’t follow her, by all means, give the book a try and you’ll probably find something useful. My favorite one is moving things closer to their location, even if you won’t put them in the right place the first time you pick them up. This switch alone can have a big impact, both in declutering and managing your life.

Although Mr. Synnott has pre-knowledge of the climb months in advance, and he has access to Alex before and after the climb, his writing about the climb in the last chapter seems shallow and adds little insight, especially if you have already seen the film.

A Must-Have Book.","Dale R.","1465478906","R2TYK0XDS3EMJW","1555490216","The 2019 New Edition of the Marvel Encyclopedia is a massive tome of information. There appear to be some subtle and major changes to the information provided in the 2016 Updated & Expanded version of this same title. For example: Yellow Jacket has changed significantly from Rita Demara to Darren Cross. The same goes for Whiplash who goes from Mark Scarlotti to Anton Vanko. I've also noticed some minor villain additions & subtractions as well. I mention this because keeping and/or purchasing previous editions of the Marvel Encyclopedia may provide information for the sake of posterity (or curiosity).

For the most part a lot of the previous information and art remain the same, but there are enough changes made to the encyclopedia to warrant a new purchase for the avid fan. The encyclopedia also remains a great source and reference for beginners to the Marvel universe. I frequently index the book on characters for my daughter, and it's helped refresh my memory on origins, powers, history, affiliations, etc.

Information on major characters like Captain Marvel, Iron Man, and Venom have changed to some degrees from the previous version. So their new info and art that's been adaptive to new information in the movies and comics as well.

Calculus is a subject I never even pondered except reading course descriptions for it in my college catalog back in the mid-90's and being grateful I was in liberal arts.

This book made me realize what I missed. It's actually a fascinating subject. Most math and science *is* fascinating, but when I went to school, both subjects were treated in a very textbook-forward way, so besides statistics, game theory, astronomy, and some physics, I wasn't able to grasp much. Now I'm able to finally ""get it"" and see how everything fits together. It kind of makes me wish I could go back to school and take all those courses I missed.

My only complaint is that the book was a tiny bit dry in some places. I'm not a fan of equations, especially in the midst of text (my brain begins to make a clunking noise when it recognizes equations....), but calculus is one of those topics where they are necessary. This is the kind of book that you chew on a bit, which is not a bad thing at all- it's just not a breezy ""read it and forget it"" kind of book.

I'm going to re-read it because I know I missed quite a bit first time around and come back to this review if I'm able to grasp more of it. But I highly recommend it.",5

"2574","Well+Good: 100 Healthy Recipes + Expert Advice for Better Living","The recipes are good, but I don't really get what it's supposed to be doing.","BirdNest","1984823191","R56VTU5W0NFXC","1555492124","This book is a beautifully shot and designed collection of 100 recipes with just about as many contributors. The organizing theme of this book is general “wellness” so each recipe notes which wellness category it falls into. Its organizing categories are dairy-free, gluten-free, keto, low-fodmap, low-inflammation, paleo, vegan, vegetarian. The recipes are classified further as to whether they help with better digestion, energy, mood, sex, skin, and sleep.

There is a chart at the back that shows which categories each recipe falls into, and the vast majority are gluten-free, dairy-free, low-inflammation, and vegetarian. Vegan is the next most common, followed by paleo and then far fewer low-fodmap.

I tested a few recipes that were quite good, but because the recipes are written by all different authors, this really only attests to skill of those particular authors and the editing of the book (not the consistency of the recipes).

Still, they were quite good, and clearly and consistently written. For mains, I made the Tempeh Tikka Masala, which was easy, quick, and filling. The Coconut-Lime Black Bean Stew took longer due to its use of dried beans, but it was a tasty, stick-to-your ribs rice-and-bean dish that produced more like 6 servings in my opinion. The Raspberry-Almond Muffins, made with almond meal, almond extract, and raspberries were incredibly delicious, and the almond and raspberry flavors worked together really well, though you MUST bake with paper liners or they will burn (I found this out the hard way).

My favorite chapter by far was the snacks chapter. The Turmeric-Tahini Yogurt Dip is so easy and tasty. It is now in my regular rotation. I paired it with the Zuchini Seeded Cracker, which are also tasty. I used a combination of teff and buckwheat flours and they worked great. The Peanut Butter Cups were your standard freezer peanut butter cups that have been on Pinterest since 2011, and the recipe produced way too much chocolate in ratio to peanut butter filling. But they still hit the spot. The Mini Golden Milk Cream Cups are very similar to other raw, vegan cheesecakes out there with the addition of turmeric. Also tasty.

There are a good number of approachable recipes in here. Some very basic, been around forever stuff. Turkey patties. A few uninspired salads. Basic smoothies. If you want it all in one place, then this might be useful. There’s definitely a heavy reliance on protein powder, which isn’t my favorite. And I went through almost a whole jar of coconut oil making the above recipes, so there’s a good amount of that, too.

Another thing, because the recipes are all written by different authors, there’s not a lot of consistency in ingredients. This can’t be avoided in compilation collections, but it may mean you have to buy an ingredient and use a teaspoon of it and then have no other ideas on how to use it from this book. There’s some hard-to-access and expensive ingredients, but I could find much of what I needed for the recipes I tried at my local, small-town grocery stores.

I take issue with some of the information in this book. On p. 21, in the description of cacao, it says “Cacao is very different from cocoa powder, which contains milk, sugar, and lots of other additives and fillers.” This is not true. Cocoa powder contains none of those. Hot cocoa mix does, but your average cocoa powder is just the cacao bean that has gone through a different processing process. In fact, the peanut butter cup recipe I tested from this book calls for cocoa powder. This is such a simple, basic fact, I was shocked at this error. I also think that much of the information in the sections on better sleep etc. come off as pseudo-science, but that’s a personal judgment.

And one more personal note and the reason I am choosing to give this book three stars. This book is LITTERED with language of restriction, guilt, and self-denial when it comes to food. Craving sugar? Broil a grapefruit! Want a crepe? Grate up some zucchini instead and call it a crepe! Where is the balance? I just fundamentally disagree with the statement “I only put what is necessary in and on my body” (p. 183). Where is the joy?

Don’t get me wrong, I do not think there is anything problematic with allergies, health problems, or ethical beliefs that inform certain diets. And I also love experimenting with different flavors, flours, and recipes. But who is this book for? If you’re low-fodmap or vegan, why not buy a book for those diets instead of this one? It seems the organizing principle of this book is just that a “wellness diet” is a diet with something—anything!—cut out of it (though gluten, dairy, sugar, and meat are the main demons), and that does not sit well with me. Can you not be well if you eat everything? What does not eating something have to do with being “well” and “good”? I don’t think this book is good for anyone trying to escape diet mentality, disordered eating, or restrictive behaviors.

To summarize: The recipes are good. The photos are gorgeous. I like several of the authors. I don't get what this book is trying to say about wellness. I could do without all the moralizing and asceticism around food in the headnotes.

Thanks to Clarkson Potter for the free book. Though I received the book for free, this is a completely honest assessment.",3

"2594","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Better than Kubrick's version.","Brian Lange.","198211598X","R3ADNB0FN5THMS","1555493978","I am going to write this review under the assumption that most of us have seen the film.  If you haven't seen the film, you may not want to read on, as there may be some spoilers.  On the other hand, I have seen the film 100 times and still enjoyed this novel heartily.  Both novel and film are radically different from each other.It has been years since I saw ""The Shining"" for the first time.  Ever since then, I had kept hearing about how different the book was, how disappointed King was with the change to the story.  I had always, at some point, wanted to read the novel to see how Kubrick changed it.  As an aspiring filmmaker myself, I am always interested to read novels that have been made into films to see how they adapted it into a screenplay.  As mentioned before, King's novel is quite different than Kubrick's film.  Which do I like better?  King's novel by a long shot.  Though I am a huge fan of cinema and love Kubrick's work... a lot was lost through his interpretation/translation of the film.For example, Kubrick depicts Jack as a menacing maniac who is out to slaughter everyone from the get-go, estranged from his mother and son who seem to look out for each other under Jack's terror.  In the novel it is quite the opposite.  Father and Son are the family members that are close, with Wendy the odd one out... actually jealous of Danny's relationship with his father.  Family interactions are lost in the film.  The novel makes much more sense as to what is going on.  There is more of a point to show that the HOUSE itself is haunted, and begins to control Jack... and his hallucinations are in fact hallucinations.  Not ""real entities"" as the film may suggest.The sequence of events differs slighty, as well as key moments in the story.  Halloran, the radio, room 217, Jack's downfall, etc.  The dialouge is more intriguing, the urgency to esacpe, the terror itself... much more hair-raising.  Even the ending is completely different.  But I definitely love this book, it rates up there with ""Misery"" of the King books I have read.  Buy it used, I got mine (first edition hardcover) right here off marketplace sellers for dirt cheap.And sorry folks... no hedge maze.",4

Most of the book is about breeds and cuts, grills and fuel, and methodology. That’s all well and good, but it makes up 90% of the book and the remaining recipes are few and uninspired. There’s a basic vinaigrette, sautéed mushrooms, mixed vegetables, a salsa verde recipe and a few variations on potatoes and not much else. The recipe ingredients are few aren’t overly complicated, which leads me to think “Why do I need this?” Recipe wise, there’s nothing I can’t find elsewhere and actually little I’d make.

She begins to collect the magazines and develops a new hobby, cooking, as a result. Her hobby opens new horizons for her: as her mother brings home strange new foods to cook and her father takes her through different ethnic neighborhoods as they search for novel ingredients. Fast forward 40 years and the opportunity of her life presents itself, would she like to be the editor of Gourmet Magazine? With warmth, candor, humor and humility author Ruth Reichl shares her decade at the helm of Gourmet. We meet her family, her work crew and learn something about the joys and frustrations of her job.

After going through it I was happy to find plenty of recipes to try where I either didn't need to buy anything or could easily use extras for other recipes (ex. flax seeds, dried fruits, nuts).
I've been quite lazy lately with my first meal of the day only eating cereal or skipping it all together, so the breakfast and smoothie recipes were what called to me most. From the book I made:
Rock+Roll granola
Tuscan Glow Smoothie
Superfood Galaxy oatmeal
Simply almond butter smoothie
Competitive coffee smoothie
I enjoyed each of these recipes. The only one that gave me a problem was the Rock+roll granola. It quickly turned dark even though I stirred it at the 10 minute mark and checked again after another 10. At the minimum of 20 minutes it was slightly burnt. I was even in the kitchen and didn't smell anything burning. Either way I'm still eating it. The ingredients are yummy and I'd make it again at a lower temp.
As another reviewer mentioned this is a compilation cookbook, and there are plenty of recipes with ingredients I've never heard of before. While there is an ingredients section in the beginning of the book it does not go over the more obscure ingredients. For example the Libido smoothie uses maca powder with no explanation to what it's for. But if you look at the boosted cbd coffee it mentions using maca powder for energy. I just wish the ingredient section was a bit more thorough.
Over-all I enjoyed the recipes I tried and will continue to cook from Well+Good (hopefully a few recipes not for breakfast!)
Thanks for the free book Clarkson Potter.",4

The Korean Island of Jeju, matriarchal society, 1930's to 2008, political takeovers by both Japan and America, dictators, suppression, trying to change a culture, religion and a way of life.  Wonderful information on the strong women of Jeju, who provide for their families by diving naturally in the surrounding waters for delicacies.  They are called Haenyeo.  This is the story of Young-sook and Mi-ja - two young women and their families as they grow up on the Island.I did love this novel.  There are some slow parts - but I can now see those parts as building blocks to the understanding of the story.  Lisa See's extensive research is evident and her ability to weave a story is exceptional  Tragic is the come away feeling of this novel.  At first profound friendship then severe hurt and loss.  Forgiveness is another theme with one character giving and looking for forgiveness and the other not able to forgive.I came away from this novel with a sense of how not being open enough to find out the whole story, both sides of the story can lead to a waste in one's life. Hurt feelings can devastate and change your world.  One should strive to be as open in hurtful and overwhelming situations as possible - not always an easy thing to do but something to struggle for - it could change your life - as it could of Young-sook's!

This one, the prequel to The Lilac Girls, is set in WWI, and follows the characters of Eliza Ferriday, Sofya Streshnayva, her Romanov cousin and good friend, and Varinka, a young peasant girl hired by Sofya.

Character development is again wonderful, and it's interesting to view the overthrow of Tsarist Russia from viewpoints within the family, through the eyes of an American concerned for her good friend, and through the eyes of a peasant girl with ties to both Sofya and the revolution.

Kelly's descriptive skills make the reader feel equally a part of the Russian royal social life before the war, the impacts of the war on Russia's people, and the response of Americans.

War takes its toll on the world, and Kelly once again weaves a story with people we come to care about who show us the price paid on several fronts.

Knowing that there was a sequel on the horizon, this time told from possibly the most famous and notorious Perez girl, I knew it would be one of my top reads for the year and I'm happy to report I wasn't wrong.

Filled with strife, and heartache but also love and friendship, When We Left Cuba will completely take readers breath away with the seamless way Cleeton once again weaves through history both past and present in a time when the world was being torn apart but so many events and conflict.

The author once again proves that she can write about a history that many of us don't know about and makes us all care deeply about it and want to learn more, until we are so engrossed with the story and the characters themselves that it changes us all. The way we think, they way we feel and most of all, changes our perspective on how we view the world and those around us.

"2739","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Well written, but overrated ... and boring","Matt","198211598X","R185TZPOQ6KC3G","1555509287","I don't really get why people think this book is so scary because it really is not.  I had to keep taking breaks and found myself rushing at the end because I was happily almost finished.  In a few sentences, ""The Shining"" is about this boy, Danny, who has telepathic powers.  Jack, his dad, takes this job as a winter custodian at a haunted Hotel, the Overlook, and he, his wife, Wendy, and son are going to live there for the season.  Then strange, NOT scary things, start happening.I read this book because:1)  My friend said it was scary and I haven't read a scary book in a LONG time.2)  I wanted to read the book before seeing Stanley Kubrick's movie.And now after reading the book:1)  I'm no longer friends with the person that recommended this (just kidding).2)  I just watched the movie and it was NOTHING like the book, which was probably a good thing.  Kubricks version was SO much more satisfying as a horror movie than King's so-called horror novel (and from what I've read King hated the film, pfff!).I didn't HATE this book, thus the three stars.  But I was very dissapointed.  ""Horror at an unflagging pace"" was what one critic says.  B.S.!  I think as a horror novel this book fails because it's SLOW.  The suspense is there, but not the punch.  And nothing really got me.  Too much time was spent on the hedge animals, which weren't scary to begin with.  And I found it VERY hard to believe when one tried to KILL someone.  The whole Masquerade ball was a borefest.  ""The elevator's moving!  Oh god!  Let's look inside.  Party streamers and a wine glass!  AHHHHHHH!""  Give me a break.  However, I have to admit that I did find the Woman in 217 and the Man dressed up as a Dog to be scary.  So it wasn't a COMPLETE waste.One thing I notice about King's books is they're very multi-layered.  And you have to be pretty skilled to pull something like he does in here off without confusing the reader, so it proves he's a good writer, no doubting that.  But the story behind the hotel was very boring.  And the ""unraveling"" off the Overlook couldn't have been  more uninteresting to me.  And something I notice with King is that when he's ""unraveling"" the story BEHIND something, it's always found in a scrapbook.  In ""The Shining"", Jack finds a white scrapbook with all these newspaper articles following the history and secret of the hotel.  And in ""Misery"", another book by King, the story behind Annie is ""revealed"" through, guess what!, a SCRAPBOOK WITH NEWSPAPER ARTICLES IN THEM.  Which NOW, leads me to how SIMILAR ""Misery"" is to ""The Shining"".  Both about WRITERS trapped in a HOUSE/HOTEL in the WINTER.  And if I were to tell you which of those to read it would definitely be ""Misery"", that's if you don't mind reading a boring book within a book (you'll get that once you read ""Misery"".)But enough with the King bashing because I have to give him kudos for making such a multi-layered character like Jack Torrance because he is EXTREMELY well written.  He has a lot of stories that make you sympathize with him and you actually like Jack, until he starts trying to, you know, KILL HIS KID AND WIFE.  However all that interesting backstory about his alcoholism, job, and father means NOTHING once we reach the end.I don't want to go on or else I'm going to give away the ending and stuff, but if you want to read a horror novel that is devoid of horror than I would recommend this one.  However, I'm sure King has scarier books in his repertoire than this.",3

It’s about sharing moments around a table with our loved ones; and even better: sharing unforgettable smells, textures and flavors from warm, sweet - almost soothing- cakes. Throughout the entire book I felt like Odette had invited me to eat at her table on a warm Sunday afternoon, and I hope you’ll feel the same because that’s the pure joy of a great cookbook.I was very lucky to receive this treasure in form of a book in advance — and thank you so much, @tenspeedpress for the free book!— so I had plenty of time to read and bake many of those remarkable cakes. And because of that I’m here to tell you from the bottom of my heart that if you’re as passionate as I am for cakes you should really buy this book and keep it forever. And if you aren’t, that’s ok too, because soon you will catch yourself in the middle of the day thinking about which of the recipes would be the most suitable for the dessert after dinner.I’ve been baking so often because those recipes are really simple yet special. You can make as much combinations as you want, it’s a real mix and match. And that’s great! I don’t always have all the ingredients in my pantry, so I can really get creative with Odette’s suggested combinations while keeping following the recipes properly.Everything about this books is stunning! The protographs, the colors, the stories behind the recipes, everything!I’ve prepared almost all the recipes and I have to say: once you try the Almond Gató (see my pic) there’s no turning back! It’s one of the most delicious cakes I’ve ever had! And I was so surprised how easy it was to bake, so for experienced bakers or not, there’s is no way you won’t end up with something delicious. the Milk and Honey Cake is also sublime and it is, from now on my number one recipe for a white simple cake. Oh, and please, pleeease try the Raspberry Curd; it’s food for angels!!!",5

All the POV characters are engaging and the palace Intrigue angle works well. Unfortunately I find it paced not quite as well as previous entries, with a little less momentum than in earlier books. In particular, the will they / won't they with Alex and Bobbie once they get their hands on the XXXXXX seems to go on for ages.  Durante as well seems oddly used after last time.

"2800","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","retelling of Hitchcock's Rear Window","Amazon Customer","62678426","RCT89SATFEXGI","1555514396","2.5 starsRetelling of Rear Window(1954) with James Stewart and Grace Kelly, minus the charm... this round the housebound main character is an unlikable female agoraphobic and former child psychologist who has given up on the outside world after a tragic event.  She drinks too much wine, is whacked on meds, possibly hallucinating, pushy AF, lurks a great deal on the Internet, and spends an obnoxious amount of time being a smack-worthy nosy neighbor via her windows... a seemingly unreliable narrator who may or may not have witnessed a murder by her neighbor across the way.Kind of a despicable protagonist I never really took to.  Helpless and weak.  Her judgement is extremely poor--outright stupid-- and this made me wish she'd get institutionalized or that someone would just take her out.  Her ""Dr."" title was farcical.  Moreover, unlike Rear Window, no one here in this cast takes the place of Grace Kelly (who had more of a spine for a 1954 woman than the hot mess in this 21st century book)... just meh chemistry with Bina (a woman who shows up for exercise), neighbor Jane Russell, her tenant David, and Ethan, the teenage neighbor.  Grace Kelly's dynamic with the older Stewart as they chat and scheme and occasionally fool around was one of the best things about the movie.  This here is just some old movie fanboy fanfic. Though much like Rear Window... one does wonder why people don't close their dang blinds when they're up to no good!!!  Who is that dumb????  Implausible!!!  This book picks up the worst of Rear Window and ignores the best.  I just didn't care about any of these people.I did like all the descriptive language and all the nods to old movies, though.  ""Jane Russell"" was a nice touch, ha ha.  Nothing particularly original here plot-wise but engaging enough plot (I didn't say characters) due to the competent writing.  It's a serviceable retelling that could make for a half decent new movie based on the old (author already has a movie deal)... but ultimately telling of Hollywood's inability to come up with new material.  Does it rate all the attention it's getting?  Nope. Just one of those new releases that goes viral but isn't really great or original... amazing how often this happens.  An okay read but definitely overhyped.  If you look at the author's résumé you'll see he's gotta have friends in high places... you do the math.",3

"2804","Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland","A Must Read","Darcia Helle","385521316","RP9HKTDGOWZ7K","1555514808","We humans are predisposed to less visceral reactions toward tragedy within the masses than toward the tragedy of a few individuals. Learning, in broad terms, about the IRA and the struggles within Northern Ireland is an intellectual experience. We feel bad, but in a distant manner. Personalizing the history with the stories of a few people who were directly involved in and/or affected by the situation gives us an emotional connection, and then we're able to truly understand and empathize. With Say Nothing, Keefe gives us that emotional connection.All that is my long-winded way of saying I loved this book. I understand the situation in ways I didn't before, not just because I read the facts, but because I felt the impact.The piece of history presented here is complex, and yet the author does a fabulous job, not so much of simplifying events, but of presenting them in a way that's easy to follow and keeps us engaged.Patrick Radden Keefe is a gifted writer. I have no doubt that the research alone was exhausting, much less the process of putting it all together in an engaging narrative, and yet I never felt the weight of it.

Much like The Man of Steel's anthology, The Caped Crusader's collection includes a series of comics from over the years and short essays by the writers and artists who have helped create the mythos over the decades. These short pieces share personal memories and overall thoughts on Batman's legacy and his connections to American culture.#27, 30, 38, 66, 140. The introduction of The Batman, Robin, Two-Face, and The Riddler. These examples from The Golden Age serve to introduce the reader to a character who at this point is mostly a sleuth and do-gooder. I found this section a great look back at the origins of the art style, the allies, and the villains. My grandmother did not keep a huge stash of my father's comics, but I remember one book from the early 50s that contained a Riddler story. I have great memories of stealing away in the sunroom to read through these books growing up.The turning point of this collection in design and content is at #400, ""Challenge of the Man-Bat."" We see a break away from standard panelling and a real evolution of the motivations of the villains and the mission of The Batman himself. At this point the writers start to turn the camera both inward to Batman's own psychological issues and outward to comment on social issues in America. From here, the franchise grows and with it the audience.This collection forced me to reflect on my relationship with The Dark Knight. Why has he retained his popularity for so many years? Why do I follow him more closely than Superman? I believe I am like most people in that I appreciate his humanity, his pain, and his dark and brooding demeanor. This won't be a debate on Superman vs Batman because there have been just too many of those over the years, but I do find myself drawn to Batman, and this book helps to verify that.Like Superman's anniversary edition last year, this is another awesome tribute to one of the titans of the comic world.",4

Michael Hyatt has given individuals a way to assess his/her productivity to really define and get clear on whether or not one should engage in certain tasks or find a way to delegate. Filled with exercises and tools, this is a super reference to help anyone reprioritize their focus to ensure that the important tasks are being accomplished based on what he/she values to gain more freedom. Reading this book helps to get one out of the mentality of “if I do more I will accomplish more and therefore be more productive.” Unlike some other books that address productivity, Mr. Hyatt has an affable, easy going writing style that reads like two friends having a conversation while breaking down the content into manageable bites. The best part is that this book makes creating a productivity habit easier to start and gives one the confidence to keep it up long term. I highly recommend.

"2820","Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder","Both Scholarly and Congenial","M Arneson","1627792767","R35JGLS9UB5BXF","1555516323","Are the classic “Little House” books memoir or historical fiction, and were they written by Laura or by her daughter? If you’re confused, you’re not alone. In this epic, absorbing biography of her great-grandmother, Fraser tells us. Between her congenial narrative and careful, detailed documentation, this author has created a masterpiece. Lucky me, I read it free and early thanks to Net Galley and Henry Holt Publishers.

Laura’s early life was considerably harder than the sepia-toned, heartwarming stories with which she recounts it. Little children could not stand to hear the grueling poverty and crushing losses her family sustained.

“Her autobiographical novels were not only fictionalized but brilliantly edited, in a profound act of American myth-making and self-transformation. As unpublished manuscripts, letters, and documents have come to light, we have begun to apprehend the scope of her life, a story that needs to be told, in its historical context, as she lived it. That tale is different from the one she wrote. It is an adult story of poverty, struggle, and reinvention—a great American drama in three acts…Showing American children how to be poor without shame, she herself grew rich.”

Wilder was a legend unto herself, a fierce, strong woman that could survive anything, anything, and everything. Her story recounts not only personal hardships, but the wide sweeping history that she lived through, from the Westward movement and Manifest Destiny to the suffrage movement, the Dust Bowl, and the Great Depression, as well as the elephant in the room: Indian removal and genocide.

The book, some 600-plus pages, recounts not only Wilder’s story, but that of her daughter, Rose Ingalls Wilder, who was, frankly, a real piece of work. Their lives were so intensely intertwined that to do this any other way would render Wilder’s story incomplete. And I appreciate the scholarly objectivity with which Fraser treats her subject; it’s not without warmth, but she is clearly not manipulating facts, as some authors do when writing about famous relatives.

And although I previously named a different title as the go-to biography of 2017, I have to recognize that Fraser’s book is a contender. Highly recommended.",4

Other readers have commented on it being life changing, and I do believe that to be so.  I am in the early stages of the book as well, and have thumbed through it. Well organized and beautifully written--except I find it very difficult to read anything that addresses a singular noun and then keeps jumping to plural. "" If your child""....""they"".  The early pages are rife with this.  Just make a comment at the beginning of the book that you will refer to he or she throughout.That said, I like the way the author refers to the toddler psyche. Toddlers don't have a mean bone in their body, for example. So true. It really has helped me remain so calm when our little toddler begins to have a toddler melt down. These are very few in occurrence and I think the advice this book shares contributes to her well being.",4

Check! Despair? Tragedy? Helplessness? Check, check, check! Like Gone Girl, The Girl On The Train, and The Couple Next Door, this book has a female protagonist with major issues, most of them brought upon by herself. The main difference is that the author this time is a male, who actually suffered from depression, so he knows how it feels to experience anxiety, loss, and helplessness. Good references to Hitchcock and other classic thrillers add depth to the read, though I figured out one of the three “big” reveals quite early on. I did expect a tad more action and suspense towards the resolution, which is why I’m giving it 4 out of 5 stars. For me, not quite as engaging as Gone Girl, but definitely more of a good read than The Death of Mrs. Westaway.

I grew up on the books and the TV show. I feel like the author was trying to decide how she felt about Laura Ingalls Wilder and Rose Wilder Lane and that her opinion kept changing.

I also feel like I did not come off learning anything I had not already read about the Ingalls family...granted it was a variety of books not just one.

If you loved the book series and have not done a lot of reading on the characters as real people this is a great book. If you have done a lot of reading on the characters as real people, this is a good book.

I really enjoyed this book. It is very clear that Caroline Fraser researched her topic very carefully and final work was outstanding. I appreciated all of the history intertwined with Laura's history and then intertwined with her fiction. I agree with other reviewers that it would have been more comprehensive if the pictures and even some of the documents referenced were included with the book. The topics were so thoroughly detailed that to view those items would have been the icing on the cake.

I have never been been a huge fan of Rose based on prior books. This book just reinforced that opinion.

One question that someone might know that I've missed - when Pa died, why were Ma and Mary living on maintenance income per 'Prairie Fires'? Given all of the funds being shared between Laura and Rose and what appeared to be the Wilder's' self-sufficiency, it doesn't seem out of line that Laura would have assisted.",4

Even without hearing the songs, however, you will feel as if you can. You will read the lyrics and become convinced that you hear the songs. THAT is the genius of Taylor Jenkins Reid is.The oral history approach never once feels like an ongoing inner monologue. You never think that you’re too deep into a character’s head. You never feel as if nothing is happening. You never wish there was more action. The story begins with a chapter that immediately fills you with intrigue and it does not let up, even when you turn the last page. The pacing, character development, and plot progression are perfection. THAT is the genius of Taylor Jenkins Reid is.It is difficult to pick a favorite character because each of them feels so real. Even Eddie, that whinging, glass-is-half-empty guitarist, earns your affection because you understand why he feels so frustrated. You might have been an Eddie in your life, working hard, using your skills and talents, only to receive nothing in return. Sometimes his complaining gets on your nerves, yet you feel like you know this guy. THAT is the genius of Taylor Jenkins Reid is.When you finish the book, you immediately want to re-read it again. You miss the characters, and you need to spend more time with them. On every page, they become real. Whether Daisy’s broken soul or Billy’s desperation or Graham’s huge heart, Karen’s ambivalence, Warren’s humor, or Pete’s mystery, you feel as if you were on a tour bus, hanging out with friends. THAT is the genius of Taylor Jenkins Reid is.The romance in this book takes many forms. The most dominant, of course, is love of music, its healing powers, its universal language. There is also the love between siblings, the love between friends, and the love of parents for their children. Romantic love, too, of course, but that comes in as many different melodies as music. Sometimes romantic love is simple and straightforward, and other times the notes are discordant, their tempo and volume ever changing. And sometimes romantic love begins with both hands playing the melody but one hand removes itself. THAT is the genius of Taylor Jenkins Reid.I loved this book. I hope you read it, and I hope you come back, hit up the comments, and tell me what you thought. Meanwhile, I’m going to go listen to the audiobook. I can’t get enough of Daisy Jones & the Six.",5

The plot is derivative and the writing style so overwritten and self conscious. Not a spoiler as you read it in the blurb anyway, but she takes photos of everything and yet the ONE thing she was meant to take a photo of, even though she has the camera in her hand, she doesn't. Too implausible. I didn't buy it.I cannot believe the editor did not strike at least half the similes and metaphors with a big red pen. Hundreds and hundreds of similes that make no sense but are just pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I love flowery writing and a beautiful simile, but when it's simply there for its own sake, all it does is draw attention to itself (in a bad way) and get in the way of the story.Reading this book is like sitting next to a man drenched in too much cologne but thinks he smells gorgeous and is trying to flirt with you. A little goes a long way, but too much is cloying and sickly.Examples: ""Her bathrobe marked the floor like skid marks"" Does the author not know what skid marks mean in UK English? (He lived there).""Streaks of rainwater like varicose veins sliding down the umbrella""""A line of hair trailing down his navel like a fuse.""""For nearly a year, scaffolding clung to its facade like hanging gardens.""Really? Cold, metal scaffolding like hanging gardens?""The ground ripples against my body. My body ripples against the air.""Not to worry, apparently Tracy Letts is writing the film script. He'll do a great job. Wait for the movie and don't bother with this overwritten book.P.S Premier étage in French is not Ground floor in UK English and First Floor in US English.

by Caroline Fraser (Author)

Where did the Ingalls come from? Why did they really leave their Little House in the Big Woods? Why did Pa keep relocating his family, starting afresh, again and again? What happened to their extended family? Did wolves really run with Pa and besiege their home? How did that Homesteading Act work, could you really get free land? Why did Pa's farming always fail? Did Laura really love Almanzo, and what happened to them after their marriage? Why did they only have one child? How did they end up in Missouri, and how did they manage to keep that farm? Why did Laura start writing, and did she get rich? Did her daughter really write all the books? Are they racist? How conservative are they, and what is the connection to the Libertarians? Where do the profits go today?

My background: I read all the LIW books as a child, and had them read to me. We watched the TV show. As an adult I read the entire series to my children. Twice. And I'll read them again for my youngest. The books I read are my wife's, from her childhood, falling apart, read to death. I pre-ordered the annotated autobiography ""Pioneer Girl"" and devoured it. And I leapt at the chance to read and review this new biography. I live in the heart of the ""Big Woods."" An hour's drive East of my house is Pepin, site of the Little House. An hour south is Spring Valley where Almanzo's family lived. The Zumbro river runs under my porch and canoeing downstream takes me to South Troy where Laura and her cousins waded, and where baby Freddie is buried.

As an adult I wondered about the ""real Laura"" and I learned much from the annotated Pioneer Girl, Laura's original autobiography. But that book is dominated by Laura's narrative, and there's only so much that editorial commentary can correct or expound when entire facets of her life were simply omitted. In any case, Pioneer Girl ended at Laura's marriage, at the very beginning of her long adult life.

Enter Caroline Fraser and ""Prairie Fires,"" a biography of two women, a textual history of their work, and the historical context of their times skillfully interwoven as a narrative. It is no exaggeration to call this a tour de force! The author has apparently made it her life's work (e.g. The Prairie Queen, New York Review Books, circa 1994) to learn everything that can be known about Laura Ingalls Wilder, including her family, her daughter, her times, and even the natural history of the Midwest. Reading this is to journey with Pa, Laura, Almanzo and Rose from the pioneering days of breaking prairie sod, through the 1890's depression, the populist era, the roaring twenties, the depression, WWII, and into the recognizably modern 1950's.

Prairie Fires starts strong, with genealogical research harking back to the colonial Pilgrim era, then flashing forwarding to the Dakota War of 1862 (a skirmish of which wiped out the Dustin family just ten miles from my childhood home, six months *after* the mass-execution at Mankato). As an aside, I don't think I've ever read a more fair exposition of that war, and the book is practically worth the price for that chapter alone. In this case the clichés are quite true: there was ample blame on all sides, but the Dakota lost and so they got the worst of it in the end.

From a formidable opening Ms. Fraser runs to strength on strength. For me the book was literally a page turner, I couldn't put it down, took it on vacation, read it in every spare moment, several times hiding in the bathroom just to get to the end of a chapter. I lost sleep, and got really clean from taking long baths. I finished it in ten days. The writing is so good I literally choked at the end, me, a grown man. It answered all the questions I had, and many I never knew I had. Along the way I learned more American history and began to understand just how and why families like the Ingalls went to the frontier. In my mind Laura Ingalls Wilder left ""fairyland"" and came into the real, recognizable world.

But Prairie Fires is not only about Laura, spilling a considerable amount of ink on her daughter Rose Lane, a very unflattering picture: selfish, immoral, manipulative, petty, mentally ill (manic depressive), dishonest, modestly talented, irreligious (flirting with Islam her whole life), plagiarizing, economically incompetent, politically hypocritical, casually anti-semitic. In a word: a fraud. For all that, we get glimpses of her intermittent success. Lane moved in fairly high political and literary circles, made her living by her writing and would have lived well but for her financial naivety. Without Rose's efforts it's safe to say we would not have Laura's beloved books at all, and Ms. Fraser is a fair reporter for letting that be known.

Yet she comes across as having an ""axe to grind"" against Lane. You will finish Prairie Fires in no doubt whatsoever about the absurdity of charges that Rose Lane ghost-wrote the LIW series, and you will wonder how it was possible for such a hack to ever make a dime as an author. Ms. Fraser seems generally in favor of collective politics, supportive of Roosevelt's New Deal programs, and bothered by Wilder's criticism thereof. She spends a great deal of energy detailing the misguided attempts by Laura's successors to corral her work into the Conservative/Libertarian cause, and in this she is somewhat successful. But her attempts to explain away the fundamental reasons why people like Laura Wilder resented the very New Deal programs intended to help them come across as feeble and condescending. We read somewhat about a religious heritage of independence going back to the Pilgrims, resentment of land use decrees, and crop destruction. But we hear again and again and again the litany of supposed hypocrisies: the homestead act was a Government Program after all, everyone necessarily took jobs off the farm, the bank where Laura worked administered Government Lending, the frontier was only open thanks to the Army, Pa cheated the Railroad, Almanzo lied on his Homestead Application... and that's about it. It's a mighty thin list to set against decades of hard toil, thrift and scrupulous morality, and it doesn't bear the weight of being Exhibit A in Wilder's Real Politics On Trial.

However, for all that, I'm prepared to be charitable. It's fair to say that while the LIW books may be conservative, they are not Conservative in the modern Far Right sense. Given the attempts of politicians to corral them into their cause, it's forgivable for someone who loves them to over-inoculate against the corresponding charge that they are little better than racist propaganda for Trumpian America. For the sake of readers worldwide, I can excuse Ms. Fraser's going a little over the top.

Oh, and about all those questions? Get the book to get the answers. Happy reading!",4

There were basically two main characters, Billy and Daisy, and while I loved Billy (warts and all), I absolutely couldn't stand Daisy. But I kept wanting to read about her, kind of the way you hate watch certain reality shows. I think there are many stars like her, people who are basically famous because they are good looking, and have rich and semi-famous parents. I couldn't like her, because I didn't feel like anything she got was earned, and she wasted her talent by being an addict. And an obnoxious one, at that.

"3063","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","Pull Down the Blind. Nothing to See Here.","L. Sheldon","62678426","R2UTPQRHQKJUIN","1555540216","The Woman in the Window moves rapidly and the writing is brisk and clear. And the author, a book editor, certainly knows his genre, although the Hitchcock and noir references at times feel like pepper sprinkled on a dish after it's cooked. And alcoholic female unreliable narrators can become irritating, rather than targets of empathy. I'll confess I dislike Girl on a Train. At least he put ""Woman"" in the title. The number of books titled (and retitled) using the word ""Girl"" has become a plague.What truly baffles me though are the reviews praising the ""twists"" in the story. I'll try and avoid spoilers here. The first twist concerns a character who claims to be someone the narrator (Anna Fox) says is impossible. Well, it isn't. If flipped, a second obvious conclusion should be glaringly obvious. It isn't until way too late in the book that the flip finally occurs. The next ""twist,"" obvious VERY early on, concerns Anna's family. The last ""twist"" can only be called a twist by readers unfamiliar with the standard mystery trope of ""least likely person.""So, all I can say in conclusion is ""Pull down the blind. Nothing to see here.""",1

It has taken years to get to this point but now that she has the Holy Grail in her possession the countdown has begun for her to have her revenge on all who doubted her. No one will be able to stop her from joining the Numen and ruling the world; until she meets Nick and Mike!Catherine Coulter and J. T. Ellison certainly have created a fast-paced and exciting tale in this book six of A Brit in the FBI. It had me on the edge of my seat more than once and holding my breath especially as Nick and Mike take a dive headfirst into the churning waters of the Indian Ocean inside a crashed helicopter! I’m not usually one to read an alien tale but there was so much more to this than little green men. Bravo ladies for another outstanding novel!!Thanks to Gallery Books and Netgalley for an ARC in exchange for my honest opinion.",5

But with all success stories, there are challenges hidden behind the scenes. The complicated relationship between band mates, the precarious balance of group dynamics, respect for the interdependent and connected artistic process, and everyone's personal demons that choose the perfect moments to come out and play.Daisy Jones & the Six is organized into a flawlessly arranged compilation of interview responses from band members, crew, family, and industry elite, allowing readers to follow most everyone's point of view while reflecting on what led to this fictional band's infamous split in 1979. The author excels at showing how perspectives can differ so greatly it's almost comical. But it's painful too. The culture of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll was running rampant, but it doesn't mean everyone was having fun. Addiction was a well-explored element in this story, showing how it touches every part of the human condition, creating lies, crossing boundaries, and damaging self-control. Another memorable element was the bold strength of the women featured. The 1970's setting was the time of second wave feminism, and subtle and not so subtle shout outs to this movement were threaded throughout this book. Full of impressive depth, a fun writing style, and the palpable feeling of making the greatest music in the world, Daisy Jones & the Six was an incredible reading experience. You'll have to keep reminding yourself it's fiction. I can't wait for you to read it!",5

It's a thriller among thrillers to be sure.  Lies does pose some ponderous thoughts that ring true.  For instance:  The funny thing about all the ""Green New Deal"" stuff is that the United States would only punish itself by enacting such stringent regulations.  You see if the United States enacted them then we would simply move all manufacturing to China.  You see they don't have the regulations.  In the storyline a town gets a billion dollar factory for one price; a sitting senator who will sl his votes to China, guaranteed for two years.I too was irritated about the Trump stuff but later in the book you get more of a sense that Lies is not necessarily on Trumps case as much as he is corruption.

"3314","Girl, Stop Apologizing: A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your Goals","easy-to-follow guide if you're starting out","KB Shank","1400209609","R1F9KMAMPJAIP3","1555564833","Girl, Stop Apologizing is the highly anticipated follow-up to Rachel Hollis’ Girl, Wash Your Face. While her previous book focused on 20 lies women believe about themselves, this book focuses on pursuing and achieving your goals without guilt and shame. For women at the beginning of a new season, those who struggle to dream, and others needing a nudge to believe in their goals, Girl, Stop Apologizing is encouraging and helpful. Just note, if you’re looking for a bible study, this isn’t it. Hollis is writing to a wide audience of woman. She does mention her faith throughout, but it’s not the primary theme.The book in a couple sentences: Girl, Stop Apologizing walks readers through a thoughtful method of goal setting and achieving. The book is divided into 3 easy-to-follow sections: Excuses to Let Go Of, Behavior to Adopt, and Skills to Acquire. Throughout the entire book, readers will feel encouraged by Hollis’ sincere desire to help other women reach their dreams. For those who struggle to set goals or feel guilty for pursuing their passions, this book offers tools and a nudge to take their first or next step. It would be great for those starting a new venture and needing some practical advice.What I liked most: The content in Girl, Stop Apologizing is practical and easy-to-follow. Women who are struggling to believe in their goals or are afraid to make a leap will find encouragement throughout. She also shares her personal struggles and goals, allowing readers to see what is possible. One of my favorite things about Hollis is her penchant for being authentic. I appreciate feeling like readers are getting the real her in her writing, not a sanitized-for-print version.I might change: If you’re naturally goal-oriented or have been working through these ideas for some length of time, you may find the text to be a slower read and less impactful than her previous book. An aspect that would have interested me, but was not discussed in-depth was the concept of the enjoyment coming from your goals—why you should stop apologizing about your success, how to balance gratitude and pleasure when you do achieve your goals.A quote to remember: “It’s time to be yourself, unapologetically, and to show the world what happens when a woman challenges herself for greatness. It’s time to stop apologizing for who you are. It’s time to become who you were made to be.”",3

I’m surprised there are only 8 reviews of this new series.  The Alex Cross series would have been snapped up and devoured by hundreds by now.  I started out thinking I wouldn’t like this series.  It seemed flat but that disappeared as soon as it became clear there was a conspiracy going on within the Army.  Poor Captain Cornwall had no clue until she figured it out.  I liked that she was on her own, driving to save her husband and daughter from danger and not knowing for sure what the danger was.  Family is important and in this book we saw the lengths one will go to save her family; we see the impact of not having a family and relying on our work the family as  CID Vasquez did only to have it yanked away from her when she discovered their betrayal.  The characters were well developed and it was good to have a strong female lead.  Let’s see how book 2 delivers before jumping on the bandwagon.  I am an ardent Alex Cross fan so I hope that Amy Caldwell can follow in his shoes, even though his are much bigger.  Good beginning.

Most people have a specific, memorable event that made them interested in true crime (if you're a murderino, you'll be quite familiar with the term ""hometown"") and there's always that defining moment that you can look back on and say, that was it, for me. I was bit and I never looked back.True crime is like that. It is kind of all or nothing, not really a dabbling kind of interest. It isn't just that Michelle McNamara had a blog (True Crime Diary), any old fool can do that (myself included), it was the way she devoted everything she had to a case that shockingly continues to go unsolved.The people who are into true crime know their stuff and usually there is one case that got away. for Michelle, this is that case.The insidious man dubbed the Golden State Killer by McNamara is not one to go into lightly. It will eat at you, get into your heart, have you keeping the lights on, staying up at night, scouring the internet, and also, on a lighter note, getting to know Michelle, an undeterred and completely unrelenting force of vitality in filling in all the blank spaces of this case.This story is a touching tribute to a life devoted to a catching a killer. At the same time it is devastatingly heartbreaking, because Michelle did not get the chance to complete her quest. This book was not finished; the monster has not been found.Some places in the narrative her absence is cruelly felt and I could sense where there could have been more, there must have been more that she was saving or would have written later. But Michelle never got the chance, having passed away unexpected in her sleep in 2016 at the age of 46.Despite that, I can't recommend this book more highly. To fans of true crime, justice, and humanity.My thanks to Faber & Faber for providing me with an advance copy of this title.",5

I haven’t read many thrillers, but this might be the book that gets me more into the genre.I really liked Anna Fox and halfway through just accepted that she’s a complete mess of a woman (her motto is “I need a drink”) and was just rooting for her to get her life together.  I really liked the old movie references and how they’re constantly playing in the background. It really adds to the classic thriller atmosphere of the novel. Also got some good movie recs out of it. I listened to the audiobook and I enjoyed the narration as well.My only criticisms would be that I called that first plot twist and I thought the ending was rather cheesy and silly. The villain literally monologues how they did it to Anna while lightning flashes across their face. I couldn’t help but laugh. It also has a lot of the same tropes that other well-known books in the genre do, so if you're looking for something completely new and ground-breaking, this isn't it.Overall, I did enjoy this book. The mystery kept me turning the pages, so it’s a fun popcorn thriller. I would recommend it if you’re just starting into the genre and I’m excited to see what AJ Finn writes next.",3

Just like the power up songs that I put on repeat when I am working on a dream and a deadline... this is the first audiobook since The Power by Rhonda Byrne that I know I will have on repeat. <3",5

And it's a serious question, worthy of a serious answer, which is why so many books have already been written on the topic by some of the best-known names in church history over at least the past 2,000 years.

What makes this particular book worth reading is that it's by a famous pastor I could (and have) sit/sat and listen(ed) to for hours. T. D. Jake's views on almost anything theological are worth a read or listen. He has a way of making his arguments simple and personal, yet convincing.

With one caveat, at least for this book - he assumes readers believe in the existence of God and accept the Bible as authoritative for Christian living. Back in seminary I was taught not to rely on such assumptions, because they only work on those who already believe. If you think God is as imaginary as Santa, and that the Bible is just stories from ancient history, nothing in this book is likely to convince you otherwise.

But for those who DO believe in the Bible as a guide for life, this book is a very readable and understandable guide to how the God of the Bible allows and uses trouble to mold us into who he wants us to be.

I particularly liked how open the author was about his own problems and fears over many years, as it's one thing to say God loves you and wills your best when you've never had reason to doubt such a sentiment, and quite another thing to still say the same after being dragged through the meat grinder of human ills.

Overall, a good read for Christians hitting a tough patch and wondering where God is in their troubles.",4

I feel like I can't move forward without conquering those fears and so I live in a paralyzed state of fear, unable to achieve the things I want to do in life or be the person I feel God created me to be.Hollis' new book called out my fears and addresses them in a way that left me so surprised. Not only did I discover that I'm not the only one with these fears (like ""It's all been done, so what can I add to it?"" as my excuse for not starting a lifestyle blog) and that I can and SHOULD overcome them. Hollis lays out steps to overcome excuses and build a foundation for personal success.Girl, Stop Apologizing is practical and real. Yes, there are lists, yes there are a few activities. But, it doesn't feel like a standard self-help book. It feels more practical and applicable than that. (Side note: I can't be the only one who finds that most self-help books are a little too listy and hard to implement.) What Hollis outlines in her book may be a challenge, but she's quick to remind you that the goal is consistency over perfection.",4

(Go ahead and jump on the disapproval train if you want to, but I read 200+ books a year and I frankly don't care if everyone else wants to be in the ""fashionable set"" and disparage this Author. I know tripe when I see it, and E.L. James doesn't write tripe!)
I knew before I bought it that it wasn't going to be another ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", so I wasn't disappointed in that respect. There were very few grammatical errors and the book was well-edited.
That being said, there was a bit too much from both of the main characters being apprehensive about showing their feelings and being too willing to hide major issues from one another. I would have liked more character development, as it seems the only character to turn out as originally described was Caroline, who actually did turn out to be Maxim's best friend. I think Maxim's and Alessia's growth is being left for the next book (if there is one.) And what about Kit? I could tell there is a lot more to explore here. I hope this is continued as a series; it will probably be a whole lot better when we get the entire story.

Initially, his victims were women. Later, his crimes would include couples. Eventually, sexual assault escalated to murder.Dubbed the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker (EAR/ONS), the predator somehow managed to evade police, despite dozens of investigations spanning numerous jurisdictions. His elusive nature, combined with the senseless acts of violence that he committed against so many, prompted true crime writer and journalist Michelle McNamara to study the case years later.The search for the EAR/ONS—whom McNamara named the Golden State Killer—consumed McNamara, who spent countless hours researching possible suspects, theories, and clues. She connected with the case on a visceral level. Fascinated with true crime since she was a teenager, when a neighborhood girl was murdered by an unknown assailant, McNamara dedicated much of her life to researching cold cases. She documented her work on her website, True Crime Diary.Sadly, McNamara passed away while in the process of writing this book, which was later completed by her co-researchers as well as her husband, comedian Patton Oswalt. To this day, the Golden State Killer has never been captured.It feels terribly wrong that McNamara didn’t get the chance to complete the work that she was so dedicated to—finally seeing the Golden State Killer brought to justice. But her work lives on, and the compassion she felt for the many victims is a worthy legacy indeed.I received an advance copy of this book from Edelweiss.",5

You might not expect a novel about trees (and much more) to be this compelling. Powers hangs his long narrative on the evolving story of a number of characters, all of whom forge some often surprising connections to trees, usually specific ones but sometimes a whole species or ecosystem. These characters are complex as are their stories. Some become radicalized and use illegal, sometimes violent tactics. This adds drama and suspense.

Powers deftly weaves the narrative with knowledge, lore and philosophy about the centrality of trees to our planetary life. Some of this is frankly didactic but it's not tedious. Human blindness and denial, consumption, greed, capitalism, and much more take a serious hit, so be warned that this novel pulls no punches. Depending on who you are, you might feel a little beat up. I found it totally worth it. The writing is often beautiful. The overall philosophy is 'deep ecology' which takes a radical position on our alienation from nature, combining science and spirituality to decenter the human and assert the primacy of the non-human, trees, animals and so on. This novel is timely. I hope it gets widely read and talked about.",5

In this model, lower prices beget customer visits which attract third party sellers leading to expanded store operations. Incremental operations are accompanied by growth in revenues which outpace the fixed costs of operation.A great flywheel compounds momentum which brings superior returns,strong client relationships, a growing asset base, economies of scale and decades long growth as in funds like Vanguard or even Fidelity.At some point, a good product offering literally sells itself.There are food applications for flywheels like potato chip applications.In chip sales, customers learn to crave the product, prices rise until the market settles, the competition drives down unit costs, profits are harvested, prices fall and the reinvested profits drive research and development efforts, as was also done in technical applications like the MOS/LSI computer microchip.""Turning The Flywheel"" by Collins is an interesting work which develops the idea of a modern product flywheel which evolves into a high profit generating machine over time and evolving market penetration and experience.This book will be helpful for organizations seeking to develop robust growth scenarios for their new and existing products.There is an extensive set of notes at the end of the book.",5

"3547","The Huntress: A Novel","Rich in historical details, powerful characters, human frailties","B. J. Taylor","62740377","RSUWX6R56K4PE","1555587581","Kate Quinn, author of the best-seller THE ALICE NETWORK, has given us another extraordinary WWII story. She has masterfully woven a tapestry of interlinking characters whose backstories slowly weave themselves together to produce a novel rich in historical details, powerful characters, human frailties, sisterhood and feminism, and justice.There’s Lorelei Vogt, the extraordinarily cruel SS officer’s wife, known as the Huntress, who has now become the target of the hunt. My favorite character is Nina Markova, a natural born aviator, one of Russia’s legendary Night Witches, an all-female night bomber regiment attacking the Germans night after night. Nina’s fearlessness and cunning result in her being the only witness to escape the Huntress alive. Caught between Lorelei and Nina, is Jordan McBride, a young Bostonian who dreams of a career as a photographer.Jordan’s world is turned upside down when her widowed father introduces her to his new fiancée. At first Jordan is happy that her father has found someone to love, but then she starts noticing things about the German widow that concern her. Soon she uncovers secrets that may endanger her life as she becomes caught up in a quest for justice led by Ian Graham, a British journalist who has become a Nazi Hunter. The murderer of his all too trusting brother is his #1 target – the Huntress.While this is a well-researched historical thriller, I also loved the story’s lighter moments, usually involving the witty Nina. She will shock you, she will make you roar with laughter, she is tough and crude. Nina is a character you absolutely cannot help loving.",5

And, the reader vividly encounters the people and problems of the period.

Perhaps the center of my disquiet about this book (and LILAC GIRLS) is the Martha Hall Kelly seems at her best when her characters are suffering. And, there is a lot of it in her books. I don't expect a novel about the plight of the White Russians to be full of frivolous fun, but Kelly's books tend to take me to places where I am more uncomfortable than the narrative requires.

The few characters that really caught my imagination (Luba, Cook, Mrs.Farriday) were relatively minor characters in the story and although we spend a lot of time with the principal characters their spirit never spoke to me the same way the lesser characters' did.

I emerged as a more informed reader---never realizing that there was so much support for the White Russian community in America, but I found myself struggling to find my way through a book that was not a difficult read, just not compelling for me.

"3574","The Border: A Novel (Power of the Dog)","Actually Four and a Half Stars","Richard B.  Schwartz","62664484","R23CKBP25SXW4B","1555589512","THE BORDER is the final volume in Don Winslow's drugs/border/Art Keller trilogy.  It is long.  720 pp. worth of long.  The texture is dense and there are many, many characters.  The NYT reviewer suggested that a list of the dramatis personae, marking their cartel relationships would be very helpful, but then it would also be a giant spoiler in that the characters change sides, betray and murder one another.  The map of Mexico which the book provides is very helpful but I too would have liked a genealogical chart of the many players.The book is not really a thriller, though there is a great deal of suspense.  It is, in part, a multi-generational saga (though not of the sort that Edna Ferber would write).  It is also what some would term a panoramic novel.  The setting is actually the U.S., Mexico and Central America and this ties in with a central theme.  Given the interconnections (legal and criminal) between the countries involved, there really is no border per se.  The borders in which DW are interested are the borders between good and evil and right and wrong, particularly as these are experienced within the individual human heart.  While the book superficially mirrors THE GODFATHER, a more profound inspiration is Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS.  H of D is the most frequently taught book in all of English departmental history.  Hence it is appropriate for one of DW's principal themes—the pervasive nature of the conflict between the doings of the individual heart and the larger cultural and economic patterns which threaten to overwhelm it.The novel is also panoramic in the sense that it offers individual plot arcs that appear to be totally different and disconnected—the life of a 10 year-old Guatemalan boy trying to make it to NYC; the life of a Staten Island junkie; the life of a former hitman for the mob who later works for the cartels, and so on.  Eventually these strands are connected.  DW is attempting to put human faces on the statistical realities and leverage the immense power of empathy which the novel-as-form enjoys.DW nails the settings, hits important themes and develops them at length, and offers a stunning array of interesting and engaging characters.  He weaves all of these materials into a set of plot arcs that eventually merge with a primary plot arc.  The craftsmanship and research which these tasks require is immense and DW is fully up to the job.There is just one problem.  DW loathes Donald Trump and has said so in uncompromising fashion in public fora.  DJT is introduced here with a fictional name but his physical appearance, the intonation, rhythms and thematic elements of his speech are unmistakable.  The 'fictional' president has a son-in-law who also works in NYC real estate.  Here (SPOILER) he is involved with a bank supported by drug cartel money that helps bail him out of a difficult financial situation.  The 'fictional' president also does things which his real-life opponents fear and are prepared to despise (e.g., he fires the special counsel investigating him).There are several ways that historical fiction can proceed.  Thomas Mallon, e.g., names names and then reinvents part of the historical record, but he does so in surprising  but always plausible ways.  In this novel the president and his son-in-law are presented as their opponents see them, with a thin fictional drape, but they are then depicted as doing things which they have simply not done or things for which no evidence has yet been adduced.  This creates a huge distraction in the novel, particularly as it reaches its climax and it unnecessarily alienates potential readers.  It gives the appearance of a settled vendetta when, we must remember, DW has been working on this trilogy for a third of his life and DJT had only been president for about a year and a half when DW presented his manuscript to his editor at Morrow.  Ruminations on our border policies also come across as preachy.  DW has created a vast and wonderful fictional edifice which can speak for itself.One wonders why Knopf did not publish the third volume in the trilogy.  In moving to Morrow (or being forced to leave Knopf) DW lost the opportunity to be edited by Sonny Mehta, the current industry's closest thing to Maxwell Perkins.  DW points out, somewhat wistfully, that Sonny Mehta was presented with some 2,000 manuscript pages for one of the first two volumes in the trilogy and then had to reduce the bulk and shape it into form.Bottom line: a great trilogy but marred by a significant distraction in the latter pages of the final volume.",4

What a treat to read about Anna and get surprise ... after surprise ... after surprise.All of these other reviews hit the points very well, yet I feel that some of  the criticisms could equally be seen as Plus-Factors.  For example, YES, it is longer than most of the books I read, but that's because it still had something new to say, some new angle to surprise the reader.  At the end, I was actually hoping it would keep going .....  It is great to spend $ for a book that I can actually read on-and-off for three days!OK, Anna is an agoraphobic and an alcoholic and that may sound like familiar ground.

Along with Midnight at the Bright Ideas Bookstore, it kind of restores my faith in the genre.  Go read that stinkfest The Girl Before for comparison and you'll see what I mean.I like the main character Anna for her clever dialogue and thoughts.  She's a mess but also well read and satirical in a way I find refreshing (love that a male author wrote a woman character who wasn't just a super-hot, karate-kicking assassin who knows how to fix cars).  For an agoraphobic, Anna probably puts herself out there more than a lot of us, but okay, that was to keep the plot from feeling too lonely.

While frantically negotiating with his contacts in the White House, Marcus learns that the unstable North Korean regime plans to use the international chaos as a smokescreen to sell nuclear weapons to Iran.This book actually seemed more like two books in one to me.  The first being the time the characters spent on the run in Russia and the second being the time spent in Eastern Asia.  And for some reason it seemed a little disjointed.  But still the whole book was very readable.  There were a lot of characters to keep track of throughout the book both in the U. S. and throughout the world.  But in dealing with governments, I realize that there are always a lot of people involved in the process.

On the 21 of June 1922, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov is sentenced to house arrest at the Metropole Hotel in Moscow where he was residing in suite 317. His possessions are taken to a 100 square foot room in the attic. His punishment is diminished when the count meets Nina Kulikova, a young girl who shows the Count every inch there is to discover within the hotel.

Towles creates a compelling cast of characters to complement the Count, none more vital to sustaining his existence than Sofia Rostov, Nina’s daughter whom she leaves in his care. Rather than resenting this turn of events, the Count raises Sofia as his own daughter, and two become inseparable. In a sense, Sofia is raised by the entire staff of the Metropol: Emile, the head chef of the Boyarsky restaurant; Andrey, the maitre d' restaurant; Marina, the seamstress who becomes a mother figure; and Vasily the concierge. The group becomes like family over the course of the Count's house arrest, and with the luxurious conditions of the lobby, bar, and restaurant.

Through the Count, we will experience the many changes in Russia, from Stalin to Khrushchev, as the hotel is the home for many meetings and dinners of the top ranking members of the politburo. He befriends Osip Ivanovich Glebnikov, Colonel of the Red Army and officer of the Communist Party. Once a week, Osip takes lessons from the count on how to become a gentleman -- now that the USSR is being recognized by the world. Through prominent figures like Osip, even enemies like the count can remain safe on a daily basis, even when the count escapes the hotel's confinement after Sofia suffers an accident. As a matter of fact, it’s Osip who makes sure she is treated by the best surgeon in Moscow and allows the count to return safely to his prison.

Relations with the west are tenuous at best but Towles relays these feelings in the Count's relations with American ambassador Richard Vanderwhile, who becomes a key figure in the novel.

As Sofia ages, she shows a talent for the piano. When Sofia is invited to play in Paris, the count sets in motion a plan to get her freedom in exchange for political espionage.

The book is a slow read, but I believe it's intended to be that way. Character development is vivid, and the minutia of the details is what actually draws you to them. There is just so much time covered and so many changes occurring, while the Count's life remained rather stagnant at times. Truly, that was his punishment - to be excluded from life outside the hotel while having a bird's nest views to watch it from the windows and balconies.

You have the internal conversations of each main character, the symbolism of the Overlook Hotel and its dark history, the physical alienation from the rest of the world during a specific season every year. You take the general conflicts that many families deal with, add seclusion, a never ending series of psychologically transcending moments, and you have one intense story.

Too afraid to step outdoors, she watches the world pass by from the windows of her upmarket New York home. Separated from husband Ed and daughter Olivia, she fills her days with booze, pills, online chess and a chat forum for agoraphobics.When the Russells move into an empty house opposite, Anna's interest is piqued. She secretly watches through the zoom lens of her camera. One evening a frantic scream shatters the silence and Anna sees something she wasn't meant to see in the Russell's house... something terrifying, something she's helpless to prevent.Oh my, I really enjoyed this debut psychological thriller from A. J. Finn. It was brimming with suspense and intensity. I didn't know what was real and what was imagined. More importantly, it kept me guessing right until the end. It was one of those books you have to keep reading until you know how it finishes. It was addictive and completely absorbing.Anna's dysfunctional lifestyle was excellently portrayed and although the book had only a handful of characters, each was developed to just the right degree with no unnecessary 'padding'. An abundance of fantastic twists and turns kept me on my toes; ok, so some the reader will figure out but others are cleverly concealed. And that ending, WOW!Anyone reading this book will naturally associate it with Hitchcock's classic 1950's movie Rear Window. James Stewart, recovering from a broken leg, spies on a neighbour through his apartment window and suspects him of murdering his wife. But there the comparison ends. Read it and discover for yourself. Or wait until the movie - yes, apparently there's a movie currently in production. Me?

"3662","Pet Sematary: A Novel","The Cat Came Back: King's Pet Sematary","Jerome E. Murphy","198211598X","R3Q7M22XOCFVWG","1555598973","This novel follows doctor Louis Creed, his wife Rachel, and their two children, who move into an old house in Maine near a haunted patch of ground that feeds on human grief and insanity, which it elicits by resurrecting any dead thing interred in its stony grip. The spirit or spirits of the place have a magnetic draw on the human mind that has led to a long, secret local tradition of this very act--mostly involving children's pets, but once in a while, something human. First the family cat gets run over, and then the family's young son. You see where this is going. When summarized, it's far-out, even laughable stuff.Yet Stephen King was afraid to re-read the finished book, his wife afraid to finish reading it the first time, and both of them afraid to see it published. They considered it too disturbing. I can even feel a faint anxiety as I write my review. That a mere book can have such effect is as disturbing as anything else about it--it seems threatening that mere printed matter should exert such power over our nerves. King latercalled it ""a dirty, nasty book.""He's absolutely right. Besides being utterly merciless towards its characters and its readers, the novel contains ideas so unwholesome, so unnatural, and such a fixation on uncanny evil, that some fundamental part of us rebels. This sets up a psychological paradox, for while our brain wants to reject what has been put before us, it also wants to accept it,due to the novel's beguiling realism (another King trademark). What this means is that a thoughtful reader will end up turning over the novel's proposals in his or her brain, and if left to obsess, could wind up very disturbed indeed. There's a reason this book scared even Stephen King.You don't become the world's bestselling novelist by chance. King fills a niche--and it's not just about horror. There is, after all, no shortage of shlocky horror novels whose plots follow storylines similar to those of King's. So what sets his work apart?For one thing, as with the work of Dickens, God is in the details. King disarms us with evocative details from everyday life long before he asks us to believe the unbelievable. He displays a unique talent in this area, and his skill is absolutely one-in-a-million. You read certain passages and think, ""Yes--it is like that, and no one else has articulated it!""This holds true for his meditations on family life, too. ""He more than half suspected that one of the things which had kept their marriage together... was their respect of the mystery--the half-grasped but never spoken idea that maybe, when you got right down... there was no such thing as marriage, no such thing as union, and that each soul stood alone and ultimately defied rationality... And sometimes (rarely, thank God) you ran into a full-fledged pocket of alien strangeness, something like the clear-air turbulence that that can buffet an airliner for no reason at all... And then you trod lightly, if you valued your marriage and your peace of mind; you tried to remember that anger at such a discovery was the province of fools who really believed it was possible for one mind to know another."" It's also clear that King writes from experience when Louis meditates on the inner life of his children and wonders tenderly, musingly, and ""not for the first time, if childhood was more a period of forgetting than of learning.""His work is designed to convince. Even when Louis realizes that his son has come back from the dead, he finds out in broad daylight, while on the phone with his father-in-law. It's then that he sees the mud tracks on the kitchen floor. The way this is described is utterly convincing, and by the time King's done with us, we're in Louis's shoes and we're all too sure that if this could happen, it would happen exactly the way it does here.Another of King's disarming tactics is the pre-emptive strike. We can't laugh the horror away: his characters have already tried to do it for us. We can't rationalize it away: we watch them attempt and fail. One of King's masterstrokes in Pet Sematary is the choice of a doctor for his protagonist--someone whose clinical sense of science and reason resists every assertion of the supernatural, the uncanny, the improbable. Louis Creed does our doubting and our disbelieving for us. The passage where Louis, finally having come round, matter-of-factly calculates the various possibilities that the return of his young son might entail, as though he were working out an algebraic formula, is a subtle example of King's brand of literary achievement.Nor can we wish away the terror by re-situating ourselves in daylight and in modernized, technological settings. Some of the most harrowing passages of the novel take place in an airport. His characters are at home in pop culture. King also has a great feel for the way that simple phrases (""It's only the loons. The sound carries. It's funny."") or even simple words like resurrection or abomination can take on uncanny meanings under the right circumstances and repeat themselves obsessively in one's mind, with cumulative ominousness. Writers will especially appreciate this effect.Throughout Pet Sematary, but especially in the book's last third, there are passages where the narrative becomes so specific, so coldly vivid in timing and detail, as to approach hallucination. The effect this has is unsettling, to say the least. For my money, the most harrowing passages aren't those involving the resurrections, but those that put us in Louis's shoes as he robs a graveyard and then carries his dead sonthrough the haunted woods at two in the morning. It was these passages that kept me awake much later, because they are the most realistic. ""This place was thick with spirits; it was tenebrous with them,"" Louis finally has to admit to himself. ""The reality of what he was doing--standing out here in the dark calling his dead son--suddenly hit him and set his scalp crawling."" I paraphrase, but you get the idea. There is reality in this book: the reality of marriage; of work; of parenthood; of  extended family relations; of neighborhoods; of death; and of evil. As after a particularly lucid dream, there is a part of us that believes what we have just experienced. It takes a little while to recover.Pet Sematary builds to a tense moment and leaves you there: it wants to stay with you. It could have been a modern literary classic if King didn't give in to his temptation to show us too much, simply because his talent at rendering the unbelievable believably entices him to do so. It should have retained the spare, taut, harrowing quality of the night-in-the-woods sequences, but it loses a little steam when we confront the monster.Stephen King has been embraced as a sort of cultural campfire yarn-spinner in the popular imagination. He's given us Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and the Green Mile, not to mention the campily enjoyable miniseries The Stand and the scare-with-a-wink Creepshow series. What's easy to forget about is the dark bite his actual novels have, and not one of them has more bite than Pet Sematary.",4

Roman","198211598X","R397N7BWNGPMOM","1555601666","Maybe I was just spoiled by reading It and The Shining over the last year, but Pet Sematary didn't do anything for me. I'd read many lists that countdown King's best 10 books, and the one that would always be in the top 5 was Pet Sematary, so I bought it. Halfway through the book, I was getting bored. 4/5 into the book, I'd read maybe 9 pages a day, not having much will to finish it. And now that I finished the book tonight, I can say that this is one of those cases where the movie's better. Ironically, the movie was only made because King demanded that he write the screenplay, and they follow it. Watching the movie is like getting a good summary of the book, because at least 400 pages here are filler. And those people that complained about the acting? Hey, it's not their fault the characters in this book aren't that interesting.But for those who haven't seen the movie, Pet Sematary is about the Creed family: Louis and Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage. They move in to a new home after Louis gets a job as a doctor at the local college, and on his first day, a student is brought in after being hit by a car, and he dies. It's a pretty bad experience, to say the least, but things get worse when the patient warns Louis about something he doesn't understand. The next night, Louis has a dream that the patient takes him to an area beyond a 'barrier' at the pet cemetery (misspelled as Pet Sematary by the children who've brought their pets there over the years), and tells him to not go beyond the barrier no matter what. But we all know how well orders like that go, especially when it's about something so full of mystery. We later learn about what exactly is past the barrier, and the history of the location from Louis' neighbor, Jud Crandall, who has some dark secrets of his own that he wants to share with others.It's hard to give the book much of a summary because most of the action is limited to two major events: going to the area past the Pet Sematary, and a major accident that involves the family about halfway through the book. Oh heck, here come the spoilers, so skip to the next paragraph if you don't want it ruined, eventhough it's pretty obvious from the get-go what'll happen, especially with how much forced foreshadowing King gives us. The area beyond the Pet Sematary is an Indian burial ground, and it turns out that those who are buried there come back to life. But not as they were before they died: they come back a sort of smart stupid, for lack of better term. The family cat, Church, is killed one night, and Jud takes Louis to the burial ground because Ellie, who just started kindergarten, can't quite handle the concept of death, plus she's very attached to Church. Church comes back, but more clumsy and slow than he was before. He smells horrible too, no matter how many times he gets a bath. Later on, Gage is killed when he runs out into the road and is struck by a semi truck. Rachel and Louis of course can't handle this (what parents could?), but Louis goes the extra mile and buries Gage at the Indian burial ground. Jud warned Louis that while most animals buried there came back ok, there was one case where a person was buried there, and nothing good came from it.I'm sure I'll get blasted by King fans who check up on the pages for books they like and make sure no one says anything negative about a book of his that they like (way to abuse the 'helpful' voting system there guys), but again, I didn't get anything out of this book. Louis is a very, very boring character, and we never get much background on him. He's a doctor, when he was younger he'd work with his uncle who was an undertaker, and him and his wife are seemingly constantly 'in the mood' now that they have a new home. Even when the horrible accident happens, there's not much description of what's going on in his mind- just descriptions of how sad he looks and other things going on. I got bored reading the same things over and over again, and was about ready to skip to the next chapter, hoping to get some plot progression or actual character development. The only characters I connected with much were Jud, since King always does a good job of making an interesting older character, and Ellie because of her dreams/premonitions. Louis has got to be the most plain, boring main character I've read about in my life. He's the Nicholas Cage of book protagonists. I never really felt bad for him.And this book is just plain overwritten. There's a description for nearly everything, from a matchbook to a doorbell design, to Louis' medical bag. And if I drank, I could've had a drinking game by having a round every time I read something about how a character peeled their lips back and frowned, or whenever the overused 'the soil of a man's heart is stonier' line was used. Oddly enough, there are a lot of typos in the book too, including some blatantly obvious ones like a comma right after a period...at the end of a sentence like this., I felt like I was reading some bootleg version of the book at one point since they'd keep showing up. Finally, what was with the ending? 'seemed like even Mr. King lost interest by that point and threw something together just to get this over with.I feel a bit bad for giving the book 2 stars, because in the introduction, King talks about how this is the only book of his that scares him, and gives us a good background on the events that inspired the story. It was very touching, and I got much more out of the short intro than I did reading the entire book. You could get away with skipping nearly the entire middle section, and essentially not miss anything. So much of the book is just describing things, and Louis being boring. It's crazy. I've only read about 7 Stephen King books now, but It stands as my favorite by far. I'd place Pet Sematary at the bottom, below Hearts in Atlantis and The Gunslinger, though I liked both of those much more. Read this only if you're interested in seeing what changed in the movie, but just know that things are drawn out big time here. Hopefully I'll have better luck with Cujo.",2

But the majority of the book deals with his experience as a fighter pilot (“naval aviator” in Navy parlance) and founder and commander of the Navy’s Topgun program.Along the way, we gain valuable insight into the problems with naval doctrine that led to the need for such a program, problems that in one way or another persist to this day in the military R&D system.This isn’t some stuffy or abstruse treatise. It’s an eminently readable and very entertaining story told by a guy who knows his subject, and how to tell it to us in a way to keep us hooked.This is one of the best works of military non-fiction I’ve ever read.

I can’t recommend reading and listening to The Mister at the same time enough. In fact, there was a moment when I had to recharge my earphones and ooh boy, did I miss the sensuously aristocratic voice of narrator Dominic Thorburn. And Jessica O’Hara Baker did a very fine job indeed narrating the female protagonist’s feelings, her cadence and that of others. James has been very adventurous mixing Maxim Trevelyan’s thoughts in first-person and Alessia Demachi’s story in third and I won’t even start on the excellent character development!

The author’s combined two complete opposites from totally different walks of life and not just made it work, she nailed it! Another detail which grabbed my attention was the truncated sentences which for me, made a lot of sense since the young lady who would rock Maxim Trevelyan’s world has a couple of problems understanding our idioms and adages. James’ carefully-worded prose knitted together with an original plot put me at ease, seeing as I had no idea what to expect. I’m a glutton for the Fifty Shades series…but this book, well, apart from having a fairy tale ring to it, I can honestly say is it was beyond my expectations.

Fast-moving if not distressing, the prologue opened up my appetite for more. Then when they meet, I had to smile because the scenario was in effect, unusual. Maxim has it all. Or does he? A constant pleasure-seeker, he’d never had trouble finding female company and despite being sorely tempted to have his way with Alessa, he does have a moral compass. Nonetheless, he can’t take his eyes off this lass with a beguiling talent, and she rather likes what she sees, too.

But there are so many hurdles to overcome in this slow burn romance. Present-day subjects such as social class, wealth versus poverty and the protagonists’ cultural differences were told fittingly. But the illegal goings on…deary me, it’s harsh stuff to stomach. Also, reading about Alessa’s plight broke my heart in two. Talk about flipping the pages isn’t in it! 80% in and all I yearned for was getting to the end just to find out if they’d have their HEA.

On a lighter note, the banter’s fabulous. Of course, being the upper-crust Brit that he is, doesn’t stop Maxim from holding back with a few choice phrases, meaning he spends a good part of his time explaining the definitions to Alessa. It all felt very natural to me. Once I got to know him; his true feelings, I wouldn’t have expected less of him.

A pleasant surprise was the pieces of music chosen to accompany Maxim and Alessia’s journey of love and trust, and an even more gratifying experience was listening to preludes and piano concertos being played in the background while listening. Maxim’s eclectic taste in music comes forth so strongly that it made me want to investigate further. I didn’t have to though. One of the gals at KFF excitedly sent me the Spotify playlist link after copying the URL by hand, knowing I’d love it. Bless her.

Anyone who knows me well is aware that I’m a sucker for contemporary romance and James has delivered. The Mister is a passionate and angsty love story and albeit long, I didn’t want it to finish. Touches of the Brit wit were oh-so-very welcomed and watching her characters’ relationship grow was an utter joy. Her descriptive writing concerning London and its surroundings and the landscape in Cornwall, made me feel like I was there. And now for the finale! Hmm…Erika, could there be more where this came from? I sincerely hope so. Bravo and thank you for giving me hours of enjoyment.",5

I must be honest and say I was a bit disappointed. As an avid reader of true crime books, having read hundreds since the 1970s, I would not place this one in even the top 20. I'm trying to be understanding, knowing that the author sadly passed away before the book was finished and someone else had to step in a and finish it. Perhaps Michelle's final work would have been different, but the book was very disjointed and was not in any type of chronological order making it very difficult to follow. There was also quite a bit of unnecessary filler which can always take away from any book. Sorry, but this just want one of my favorites and I doubt I would recommend it to others.My thoughts and prayers go out to Michelle's family and friends, especially her husband and daughter.

Scaggs","1524798622","R3HKUUQLPCP56Y","1555605936","When I first started hearing about Daisy Jones & The Six, I had absolutely NO interest in reading this book. I am not a fan of Rock N’Roll. I barely listen to music as it is, and when I do, I definitely do not listen to anything in that genre. I convinced myself that this plot would have little to offer me. Nevertheless, after @BookSparks announced this book as their final pick for #WRC2019, I caved and picked Daisy Jones & The Six for my March Book of the Month selection.OH. MY. GOD. I am eating my words because the book was PHENOMENAL! I was devastated when I finished the book because I didn’t want this incredible story to end.The first thing that immediately sucked me into this story was the format of the book. The story is told through a series of oral interviews featuring how Daisy Jones & The Six came to be. We are introduced to Daisy Jones, her best friend Simone, the six members of The Six (Billy, Graham, Karen, Teddy, Eddie, and Pete), and other important characters such as previous managers. While this sounds complicated with the multiple POVs, it’s executed brilliantly because the story feels is reminiscent of watching a documentary.The story is set in the mid sixties – late seventies. Right off the bat, we are introduced to Daisy Jones who is devastatingly beautiful but desperate for love and attention since her wealthy parents are too busy to acknowledge her existence. At the age of 14, Daisy immerses herself into the infamous Rock N’Roll scene of Sunset Strip in L.A. by taking whatever drugs she was given and sleeping with whatever rockstars she hung around with. As she continues this trajectory in her teens, she begins to realize that the men she is surrounding herself with just use her for her natural musical talent then cast her aside as a used rag doll once they’ve had their fill. She decides that she will become a star on her terms, and she’s done being someone’s groupie.I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else’s muse.I am not a muse.I am somebody.End of f*cking story.– Daisy JonesThis story is powerfully feminist. All of the female characters are strong, fierce, and a force to be reckoned with. My personal favorite is Camille. She would do anything for Billy and her family. What I loved most about is that she knows that she married a rockstar and never tries to change the man he is instead she is always there to help build him up no matter. This woman is incredible!The story tackles themes of love, heartbreak, loss, betrayal, friendship, and addiction. I think Taylor Jenkins Reid does a spectacular job of tackling the raw truth of addiction without either downplaying or glamorizing it. She shows just how debilitating this disease is and that it is a constant battle every. single. day.After finishing Daisy Jones & The Six, I am officially a Taylor Jenkins Reid fangirl. The woman is an absolutely brilliant storyteller. There were several times in the book that she 100% had me convinced that this was a real band (and yes, I did google to check!). This is one of those books that I will be recommending (more like shouting) to anyone who will listen to me.",5

But ‘The Woman in the Window’ is well worth a read, with an original spin on a familiar plot. There were definite similarities between this novel and ‘The Girl on the Train’ and I’m sure this book will be compared to that one, but unlike the female character’s in TGOTT (who I found to be, weak, selfish, and difficult to relate to) I felt a lot of empathy for Anna and it made sense to me why she was unable to leave her house. The detailed descriptions of Anna’s surroundings made me feel like her home was my home, and I could see why she felt safe there. As a long time Alfred Hitchcock fan I loved all the references to his movies, and also that the plot of this novel was Rear Window-ish. I felt the plot dragged in places, and the mystery was a tad predictable, but still a well-deserved 4 stars, and a first novel to be proud of.",4

Unlike Reese Witherspoon, I did NOT read the entire book in one night, but I did stay up quite late the last night reading the final 150 points in one sitting. The book does have an Almost Famous vibe about it, but the book is really its own thing. The narrative is interesting -- alternating across each page between all the different voices of characters in the band. As a result, you don't go super deep into any one character's psyche, but you do get invested in how each character sees the same episodes and storyline. So much of what the book is describing is visual that you almost feel like there should be a fake center with glossy pictures of the Rolling Stones and album covers described, the band members, etc. At the end of the book (not a spoiler really), you get all the lyrics of all the songs on their famous album. It's weird to read the lyrics without having any music or tunes to go with them. In a way that's a testament to the author's work, I wanted to *see* and *hear* this world she creates with her words in the book itself. You can easily see this book becoming a ""mockumentary"" -- a fictional documentary (not a satire). That's the style in which it's written. I'm curious what a true music lover or band member would say about the authenticity of the world she creates. I'm as knowledgeable as one of the fans in the book, so I was just along for the ride. And a fun ride it was with lots of different angles and some really deep moments and wisdom interspersed with rock-n-roll rowdy fluff. There's a meta-feel to the book that makes it more interesting than just another story about a rock band. I enjoyed it enough to pass along to a friend and recommend to another friend.",4

Since my son has now read every single Big Nate book ever published I decided to read Payback Time to see if the humor has stayed fresh.Surprisingly, despite some 25 odd years, Lincoln Pierce continues to find humor in the adventures of the self-obsessed but good natured and likable Nate.  While certainly not for adults, my nine-year old was laughing out loud while reading.If your child already likes the humor of Big Nate they’ll like Payback Time.  Nate continues to experience the stress, joys and perspective of the pre-teen years of many Americans.  If Big Nate hasn’t been to your child’s liking, don’t expect any changes. The same formula persists as in earlier books, to the point where certain cartoons almost seem formulaic.But less important than my opinion is my son’s who simply devoured it.  In a few words, Pierce writes a new book with the same winning formula he has used for several decades.  Recommended for elementary school aged children.",3

It made me want to write this before I received the entire book. It was advertised as “A personal and empowering blueprint—from one of America’s rising Democratic stars—for outsiders who seek to become the ones in charge” which for the part that I read was bs. What I read was simply wisdom. I didn’t see that gender or color or party made this better or worse; it was simply wisdom. The hurdles she shared that she had to get over were not really any different for what I saw growing up. She shared the wisdom that she discovered. The biggest part of the author being black and a female was that other black females will more likely read it. That is good. An even wider readership would be better. A strong, aggressive reader probably doesn’t need any push to read, but others do. I think that this will be a great book to read in its entirety. Maybe the book's ‘feel’ will change as it goes on, but I feel that should be of value as long as it is read analytically and thoughtfully. By the way, I am a 60 year old white guy born in Kansas and living in Georgia that believes that wisdom should be accepted from wherever it comes. Blessing to y'all.",5

Not sure why the movie didn't follow the book more closely because it would have been so much better.  Shelley Duvall couldn't have played Mrs. Torrence from the book and even been right for it.  Let's face it, half way through the movie, I wanted to bash her head in.  Her whining version of the character made me sick to death.  So weak and so lame.  How did they even choose her for that part?  At least the book character had some backbone.

He's a recovering alcoholic and has a bit of a temper issue, landing him in trouble.  He is left with no other option but to rely on a friend to get him another job.  Jack, his wife Wendy, and their son, Danny, will relocate to Colorado for the winter so Jack can be the caretaker for The Overlook Hotel.  The family will be snowed in for the winter and will look after the hotel in its off season.  They will have the run of the place, just needing to attend to small chores and ensuring the place stays heated so the pipes don't freeze.  The Overlook Hotel has a storied past, as Jack soon finds out.  There have been very famous guests and infamous gangsters...grand parties, and hushed up murders.  The Overlook has a dark history and it is looking to incorporate the Torrence family into it, playing on dark desires and fears to get what it wants.This is one I've been meaning to read for quite some time.  Glad I finally got to it.  Danny and his Shining definitely made for an interesting story line.  He was able to feel what was going on, but was unsure what some of it meant since some aspects were too grown up for him to really understand.  King is a master story teller and allows for the writing to just flow off the page.  While it wasn't overly horrific, it did have a good psychological thriller aspect to it.  I definitely was able to feel the fear and pent up terror the family was feeling in the confines of the hotel.Some quotes:""We'll always be friends, and the dog collar I have on you will always be ignored by mutual consent, and I'll take good and benevolent care of you.  All I ask in return is your soul.  Small item.""""This inhuman place makes human monsters.""""The Overlook faced it as it had for nearly three-quarters of a century, its darkened windows now bearded with snow, indifferent to the fact that it was now cut off from the world.  Or possibly it was pleased with the prospect.  Inside its shell, the three of them went about their early evening routine, like microbes trapped in the intestine of a monster.""""The whole place was empty.  But it wasn't really empty.  Because here in the Overlook things just went on and on.  Here in the Overlook all times were one.""""In the Overlook all things had a sort of life.  It was as if the whole place had been wound up with a silver key.""""In the east-wing ballroom, a dozen different business conventions were going on at the same time within temporal centimeters of each other. ... And he could almost hear all of them together, drifting through the hotel and making a graceful cacophony.""",4

McManus's goal in this book is to give practical tools to help the believer live in victory and walk in peace. While I do think this is achieved in the book by exploring ancient biblical principles, it is a hard read. It's intellectual and full of many complex thoughts and it is intense. Does that mean it was bad? NOT AT ALL! In fact, I think this book is incredible. It just isn't a book you can breeze right through and catch all of it. I think this book would be best read in small chunks (5-10 pages with a highlighter!) so that the reader can really digest the information.This book is difficult for me to explain (as I'm sure you've already seen!) There is no doubt that McManus is passionate about what he is teaching and I think that despite the heaviness of this book, it is what kept me reading. You can feel the passion in the pages.I also feel like this book is great for men. The tone, to me, is masculine and the stories are more appealing for men. I kept thinking of Christians who have maybe grown stagnant in their walk and this book helping to revive them and move to a new place with God.I hope all of that makes sense.**Waterbrook sent me a complimentary copy of this book.**",4

I imagine her sitting there in the court room, looking him straight in the eye, knowing justice will be served and the killer she was obsessed with finding had been caught.Michelle McNamara was a true crime journalist who started the website TrueCrimeDiary.com. She was determined to find ""The Golden State Killer"". A man who committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before he moved south where he murdered ten people. Michelle interviewed various detectives working diligently to solve the crimes, she read police reports, interviewed victims and their family members, she devoted countless hours to research, traveling to various locations, collecting box after box of reports. She educated herself on various forensic devices used to track and identify killers.Through her writing, she showed not only her humanity but the humanity of the victims and the police officers investigating the cases. She shared bits and pieces of herself with the reader. She shared what drove her desire to hunt this killer, she showed us glimpses into her private life and her relationships with those close to her. She poured her heart and soul into her research. She was intelligent, determined, and never gave us her quest for the truth. Her devotion is admirable and earned her the respect of the men and women in law enforcement who were also trying to capture this killer.""Her prose jumps off the page and sits down next to you..."" This book was completed after her death and various sections of the book inform the reader of what chapters were finished using Michelle's notes. This true crime book is nothing short of a masterpiece. There is a lot of information in this book. There are also maps and pictures of some of the victims. This is a very comprehensive book but also one that is very readable.Highly recommend!",5

"3912","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Recommended","Jacob Glicklich","198211598X","R5BU06KI7HA88","1555625308","What makes the story work is the depth given to characterization. Normally King's characters are pretty flat, but here some pretty intense and well rounded psychologies are pulled off. In particular Jack Torrence emerges as one of King's more effective protagonists/villains, a main of equal measure talent and frustration, deeply flawed but aware of this and trying to overcome his own propensity for alcohol and violence. And this allows the main conceit of the novel to work, perhaps better than it should. Making the violence occur not because of flaws in Jack's character but from ghosts could so easily have turned trite, or delivered what TV Tropes would call a Space Whale Aesop--a situation too rooted in the fantastic to really be relevant, and with murderous domestic violence that risks downplaying the significance of the reality in the premise. To an extent this occurs, particularly in the climax, but the major buildup makes it more complex. The final result is not Jack becoming psychotic purely on his own devices or him being bodyjacked by ghosts. Instead it's a process of corruption and seduction, at once metaphysical and deeply personal, which in itself builds up a lot of pathos on all sides.",5

Alright, EL James was my very first read (and I mean i NEVER read books for fun or even when I had to for school). After reading the Fifty Shades Trilogy I was hooked on ROMANCE. So needles to say I AM A HUGE EL JAMES FAN and she got me started on reading romance!

I was so nervous to start reading this because I wasn't sure what to expect. It was NOT anything like I expected or didn't. I keep having to remind myself that this is not part of the fifty shades, it's a whole new..everything...and WHICH IT IS!! You can very much tell this is a EL JAMES book because of the writing, some words and the style. I have nothing to base this off of except as a NEW read, so it was rather shocking to me. This is VERY from the 3rd person narrated and you get both POV's. Younger heroine, age 23, older hero but not by too much. Maxim is a man of many talents, aside form being Earl of Travethick..photographer, DJ and a composer, among other things.

This to me aside from some IRONIC words used to reference fifty shades in the book, is a very MODERN PRIDE & PREJUDICE feel...with a twist. The ending about killed me, that was a rush! While reading you're constantly anxious to what will happen next. It's exhilarating. Edgy. Romantic. Stimulating. It grows on you. Just...beautiful.

I am rating this a 5 PLUS PLUS & HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! It is definitely making the TOP 2019 MUST READ list!

The obvious is grapes crushed to make wine, carbon crushed to make diamonds, wheat crushed to make flower etc… And then there’s me, the physical human being living a spiritual life. I too am under the same physical laws. I crush my body in the gym to make it strong, I crush my mind in books to make it smart, I crush my spirit in The Word to make prosper. And then there’s the crushing that I never want or expect. These are the crushings that challenge me to rise above and become a better, more refined person. IF and only IF I do not identify with the crushing experience. If I can let go of the emotional attachment and keep pressing on, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead. IF I can allow God to process me then I will come out of the valley of the shadow of death a new and improved me…. Wow, what a revelation for me. I very much recommend this book.",5

It starts off quite well, a father desperate to find and save his junkie daughter who he hasn't seen for ages, learns she might be about to perform in a John Lennon themed part of Central Park. Sure enough she turns up and starts to sing, but when he tries to get her to come home, her boyfriend who made her a junkie gets between them as she runs off. He punches the guy in the nose and is set upon by tourists. To make matters worse video of the assault which doesn't of course show the whole episode goes viral (which is interesting as we see this happen in the real world) and the father becomes the most hated man in America. This was an interesting storyline at this point, I loved how he handled the private school teacher who just drops him and his wife from a charity event that only exists because of his donations in the first place. But then it becomes well kind of stupid when he and wife visit his daughter's old junkie pad after police tell him of its existence, because he's now a suspect in a murder there. From that point on it becomes an average novel that you've read countless times before.

You don't have the usual desire to forget TV and everything else going on in your life and turn the pages like you usually do with a Coben novel. In fact you're only finishing the thing because you know how good an author Coben is and are hoping it will somehow become good. It doesn't. Events go down in a way that are foreseen by scenes before them. You're not surprised at all by the ending. A shame as you're always looking forward to a Coben novel once you find it's about to be released.",4

"4077","QAnon: An Invitation to The Great Awakening","“QAnon: An Invitation to the Great Awakening”: A Book that Will Help Define History","Suzanne Natafji","1942790139","R2E5C1GZJ3J6SF","1555644040","(4.5/ 5 Stars)Have you seen ‘WWG1WGA’ on T-shirts, hats, and other paraphernalia? What does this acronym mean and where did it originate? Have you seen the video, “The Plan to Save the World” (from the written chapter 1 narrative)? Does the narrator’s voice seem vaguely familiar?What/ Who is QAnon?This book, penned by multiple chapter authors, is not about parties; it is about long-term, underlying issues – identifying and resolving them through deep research, discussion, and dispersion, in order to help our society flourish.Each chapter is written by one/ several people, who include post-chapter links about their specific topic. Some of the chapters also contain graphics.Because we live in the age of online media access, the authors made sure that this book was links-driven. However, this means that for this book to be fully-read to include the accessing of every link, readers would have to physically type in each and every one of the supplied links to access them online, which very few readers would do. This problem needs to be addressed by also including a soft-copy online (preserved by a special password and linked with every hard-copy sold); the soft copy would contain the ‘hot’-links for accessing the chapters written by every author listed. (I subscribe to journals that utilize this same bundled format.)As such, the hard-copy would be read for main ideas and have its place on a physical library shelf, while the soft-copy would contain all of the chapters plus their clickable hot-links to access videos as well as articles. This format truly represents how information is accessed in today’s world. Given that the purpose of buying and having books is to educate people about a topic, if a book with links doesn’t have easily-accessed links online, readership may wane. Profit-making isn’t key in this situation: knowledge acquisition of readers IS. The main key then is increasing knowledge about a topic, so having a hard- and soft copy bundle is important.Some of the most interesting books in print contain a high amount of graphics, so the soft-copy part of the bundle helps solve this and keep hard copy costs low, while at the same time pique readership interest to also use the soft-copy, to access highly graphic information.Hopefully, this problem will be addressed and solved before the book’s 2nd edition comes out.This ‘Great Awakening’ topic will be of growing interest as more people become familiar with it. You, as the reader, will become part of this important process.The book’s first chapter is “The Plan to Save the World”, written by Joe. M., and he also narrates the video by the same name. (Run an internet search to pull up and watch the video, which is expertly produced.) Joe’s voice seems vaguely familiar, while it is also comforting and reassuring.Other important chapter authors, for example, include: SerialBrain2 and RedPill. Buy the book to read the chapters penned by not only these three authors but also all of the rest of them, as well.We live in interesting times. A more precise way to define them is by looking through Charles Dickens’ lens: “It was the best of times; it was the worst of times”. How will future generations define this particular juncture of history? Reading this book, sharing it with others, and discussing main ideas amongst ourselves will hopefully create a better understanding of our world as it now is.However, during this process, be prepared to hear some people say: “This can’t be true” about some information. Then, be prepared to gently engage in back-forths to help them understand that an idea MAY be true. Ask a lot of general (slowly leading to specific) Information Questions (non-Yes/ No). Be sure to use skill and understanding during this process because this might eventually change a person’s entire paradigm of understanding about how the world works.This book will help nudge that process by means of critical thinking and critical discourse, which I think is the intent of why this book was written.Because of the lack of a soft-copy with hot links bundled with the hard-copy for total link information access, I rate this thought-provoking book at 4.5 stars. However, because Amazon doesn’t have .5 increments and because I believe that a 'hot'-link soft-copy bundle will be included in the book’s 2nd edition, I bump my rating up to 5 stars.",5

I listened to the entire book on Audible in less than 24 hours. It is her blunt, deadpan delivery that makes her so hilarious.

I laughed, I felt her pain, and there were even takeaways from her experience that one can apply to their own life. And for the record, the chapter on Bert and Bernice had me laughing out loud. I listened to part of it while at work, and I had to pop my head into my coworkers office to say ""if you hear me laughing, it's because I'm listening to Chelsea Handler's book.""

Reynolds","0143110438","R1TNECTLSQNRMF","1555647857","Shortly after Count Alexander Rostov’s house arrest at Moscow’s Metropol Hotel, he makes the acquaintance of Nina, a precocious nine year old who takes him on various adventures throughout the hotel looking for secret rooms and passages.  Getting the “lay of the land,” he is able to enlarge his living quarters by knocking out the closet’s rear wall and gain access to the vacant room on the other side.The count’s sentence apparently has no ending so he is witness to some thirty-plus passing years as a resident and later an employee.  Nina returns much later but is not the only woman in the count’s life; he has the occasional tete-a-tete with a prominent actress who helps the count in several difficult moments, thanks to her connection with key Soviet officials.  Nina is searching for her husband but has her own daughter in tow, six year old Sophia.  This time, Nina manages to sweet talk the count into taking care of Sophia while she’s gone.  At first, the count is apprehensive but gradually he assumes the role of Sophia’s father while Nina is away.Towles is a clever writer and easily gets the reader committed to follow the lives of these characters as if they were family.  He also comments on the passing political scene as Joe Stalin comes to power, the Russians withstand the German onslaught in WWII, Stalin dies, and Nikita Kruschev rises to power.  He also notes the change in the cultural scene with some unexpected humor.  When jazz is performed at the hotel, the count remarks about a peculiar song dealing with the absence of bananas.  On the political scene, he posits what might happen if a person seized the illegitimate daughter of a Politburo member and put her in a home:  such initiative would be rewarded with a blindfold and a cigarette.An enjoyable reading experience as Count Rostov manages to have a full and meaningful life though constrained within the boundaries of a luxury hotel.",4

"4145","The Woman in the Window: A Novel","Terrific mashup of Rear Window, Girl on a Train, and Gaslight","Heather MM","62678426","R52GXXCI4EAKA","1555650468","In The Woman in the Window, A. J. Finn draws inspiration from classic Hitchcockian suspense films and the slew of successful “Girl” psychological thrillers in his mashup of Rear Window, Girl on a Train, and Gaslight. Although the writing is uneven at times and the story feels familiar, it’s a nice addition to the genre and it’s going to make a terrific movie.Anna Fox hasn’t left her house for months, due to a crippling case of agoraphobia. The cause of her anxiety is a mystery within the mystery, and its revelation is a gut punch. As a former psychologist, she knows exactly how to treat her condition, but is unable to manage. The irony doesn’t escape her, and she tells the tale with a detached, sardonic, and often very funny voice.The beginning of the book establishes her routine, which consists of spying on her neighbors, watching classic mystery movies, and consuming large amounts of merlot and prescription pills. The occasional visits from therapists, interactions with the downstairs tenant, and phone calls with her separated husband and daughter are the only things that break the monotony. It seems she could continue in this depressed lifestyle for a long, long time, wandering through her Harlem brownstone in semidarkness. Before long, the five-story house feels claustrophobic, even to the reader.It must be difficult for an author to give a character motion in such a closed setting, but Finn’s abundance of synonyms jarred after a few unusual instances. Anna surges, steals, stalks, subsides, slopes, scurries, scuttles, and shuffles into rooms. She pivots and pours, keels and clops, wades, lurches, ebbs, travels, trips, treads, trudges, fumbles and flies around her house. Sometimes the thesaurus needs to go back on the shelf and a character should simply walk.The Russell family moves into the neighborhood, giving Anna something new to watch through the powerful zoom lens of her camera. The teenage son, Ethan, and later his mother, Jane, visit Anna and she soon suspects the family’s dysfunctional. One day, she hears a scream from their house, then days later, while spying on them, she sees Jane murdered.Or does she? The police are skeptical about her story, especially since her blood alcohol level is twice the legal limit and her meds can cause hallucinations. The Russells deny anything happened, and a new Jane Russell is conjured from Boston. The frustration Anna feels at being dismissed felt visceral to me, perhaps even more so with all the #metoo stories of women not being believed in the news. But the police raise good questions. Perhaps Anna’s confusing the Hitchcock movies she adores with reality.The way the truth comes out disappointed me, although I believe it’s a common method in Hitchcock films. And parts of the villain’s persona didn’t gel with me. Would this person really “giggle” so often while disclosing the evil plans? And some of the methods used to unhinge Anna seemed a stretch. But the plot is tight, which is satisfying.A real strength of the book is the descriptions of Anna’s panic attacks when she attempts to step outside the house. Her stream-of-conscious thoughts place us right beside her, experiencing her fear. “And then it bulges toward me, swelling, now rushing, a boulder flung from a catapult; slams me with such force, walloping my gut, that I fold. My mouth opens like a window. Wind whips into it.” Powerful writing. Knowing Anna’s backstory, we root for her to conquer her fear, and when she does, it’s almost more satisfying than a well-plotted mystery becoming clear.But not as satisfying as hearing the previously dismissive detective tell her, “I owe you an apology.”",4

"4190","Discrimination and Disparities","Disparities don't automatically (or even usually) equal racial Discrimination","Richard Kirk","1541645634","R1Q9OT5ULW4OPP","1555654544","“Just the facts, ma’am.”  That was Joe Friday’s interrogation refrain on Dragnet.  The same comment could serve as the sub-title of Thomas Sowell’s recent book, Discrimination and Disparities.  Few works focused on politically explosive topics maintain such a consistent focus on empirical evidence while avoiding rhetorical jabs at opponents.  On the other hand, empirical evidence cuts deep, especially when critics can’t protest the author’s “nasty” style.  As radio talker Larry Elder observes, “Facts are to liberals what kryptonite is to Superman.”Sowell’s title, if employed by a member of the leftist intelligentsia, would doubtless imply a causal link between statistical disparities and some form of discrimination--usually racial. Sowell, by contrast, marshals an abundance of evidence to show that this automatic assumption isn’t justified.  Focusing simply on statistical probabilities, Sowell notes that if five prerequisites are needed for success in a particular field, and if the chances are two out of three that any person will have each characteristic, the chance of possessing all five characteristics is still only one in eight--a calculation that helps explain why most pro golfers have never won a PGA tournament while Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods have collectively won over 200 times.  Consequently, “Given multiple prerequisites for many human endeavors, we should not be surprised if economic or social advances are not evenly or randomly distributed among individuals, groups, institutions or nations at any given time.”Among leftists, however, assumptions about the random distribution of characteristics stand at the heart of various discrimination suits.  Thus, if proportionately more blacks than whites are given tickets for speeding, this statistic provides for them prima facie evidence of racial discrimination.  Sowell, however, offers clear counter-evidence that black drivers are more likely to exceed the speed limit than white drivers.  Similarly, the assumption that racial discrimination is the primary reason blacks are overrepresented in the prison system is countered by noting that blacks are vastly overrepresented as both perpetrators and victims of murder--a crime that’s hard to ignore.  Sowell further observes that fatherlessness clearly increases the likelihood that a person will end up in prison since a majority of prisoners “were raised with either one parent or no parent” --a domestic circumstance that applies to well over half of all black kids in the U.S.In short, Sowell shows that many or most of the disparities that afflict black Americans are due to behaviors to which even other blacks have objected.  In the early twentieth century, for example, long-time black residents in Chicago publicly chastened new arrivals from the South for behaviors that would, and eventually did, have negative repercussions for the entire community.  Today, however, most black leaders ignore the plain fact that merchants in high crime areas, for example, must charge higher prices to squeeze out lower profits than stores in safer parts of town--preferring to blame the proprietors’ racist-fueled greed. Only blacks who’ve moved to safer suburbs can be counted on to protest  government policies that again place large groups of unsavory characters near them under the failed assumption that a middle class environment will alter bad habits.Sowell also provides surprising examples of cases where the desire for profit actually won out over racial discrimination.  Early in the twentieth century, for instance, attempts to maintain a white Harlem were foiled by the sheer economic advantages available to landlords who ignored the neighborhood’s segregation policy.  Likewise, privately owned municipal transit groups and railroads both protested and often ignored laws that mandated segregated facilities.  Indeed, railroad management actively worked with Homer Plessy to overturn segregation mandates in that industry--a legal effort that ended unsuccessfully with the Supreme Court’s Plessy v Ferguson “separate but equal” decision in 1896.  Amazingly, Sowell shows how the profit motive often trumped segregation laws or compacts even in apartheid South Africa and in the post-bellum South.  Put succinctly, it was racist politicians, not transit owners, who insisted that Rosa Parks sit at the back of the bus.Sowell focuses additional attention on well-intended government policies that succeeded in increasing, not decreasing, racial disparities.  In this regard significant space is devoted to the negative consequences of minimum wage legislation.  Sowell notes that in 1948, when the minimum wage was economically inconsequential, black teen unemployment was actually lower than white teen unemployment and a fraction of its rate when the minimum wage was substantially increased.  Sowell also laments the destruction of a traditionally stellar black educational institution, Dunbar High School in Washington D.C., when self-sorting, education-focused black families and students were subjected to politically-driven and empirically-destructive fantasies that involved bussing and the abolition of selective institutions like Dunbar.Similarly, in order to racially “unsort” neighborhoods (as they “unsorted” schools) politicians ignored economic facts that explained why banks (including black-owned banks) disproportionately rejected blacks’ mortgage applications.  Instead, legislators insisted that financial institutions lower lending standards to achieve the politically desired “random” racial distribution of house ownership--a misbegotten policy whose economic chickens came home to roost in 2009.  Meanwhile, various government laws that decreased the supply of housing and increased prices were “successful” at reducing the Bay Area’s black population in 2005 to less than half its number in 1970.Throughout the book Sowell discusses a number of other factors that clearly lead to “disparities,” leaving aside the kneejerk assumption of racist motives.  Being first-born or an only child, for example, has immense advantages, benefits indicated by the fact that twenty-two of the twenty-nine original Apollo astronauts fell into one of those two categories. Additionally, in a chapter titled “The World of Numbers” the author debunks several beliefs about disparities that are rooted in false assumptions about statistics and the lack of economic mobility.  Thus, one study found that 95% of the people in the bottom income quintile were no longer there fifteen years later and that 29% of them had risen to the top quintile.  Elsewhere Sowell explains how falling “household” incomes are consistent with rising “personal” incomes simply because the average size of a household has fallen substantially.  (A two-person household where each individual earns $20,000 represents a household income of $40,000.  But if both members of the household begin to earn $30,000 and establish separate residences, the income of each one-person household is now 25% below what it was before.)Much of Sowell’s book is recapitulated in his final chapter--and with a bit more rhetorical intensity than previously exhibited.  A few new topics, however, like the destructive consequences of a grievance mentality and “black English,” are also addressed.Overall, Sowell’s book is a protest against the unfounded assumption that “there would be no disparate outcomes unless there were disparate treatment.”  Sowell observes that this ideologically-driven assumption “seems almost impervious to evidence.”  Accordingly, those who cling to this dogma with religious fervor will likely avoid Sowell’s fact-filled book like  kryptonite.  Folks with less dogmatic proclivities, however, would do well to peruse this concise work.Richard Kirk is a freelance writer living in Southern California whose book Moral Illiteracy: ""Who's to Say?""...  is also available on Kindle .",5

I promised myself I would read the book first, so I could further appreciate a film everyone but I had seen.So after finishing King's nearly 700 pages during three nights in an ancient apartment in early December, I sauntered over to the video store.Three hours later, I wondered what the big deal was.While reading the book, I shuddered every time the phone rang in my bedroom or the heater awoke copper pipes in my building. After stretches of 200 pages or more, I held the book closed in my lap for 20 minutes before I could sleep, convincing myself that I was not Jack, that I was not Danny. In the book, the ghosts are spooky and the tension is startling. But what is most chilling, what kept me turning at 4 and 5 a.m., were images such as Jack's mother on the kitchen floor, wasps under burning leaves, a mangled bike tire in the rear-view mirror and the bitter taste lingering during an Excedrin buzz.Save the two pale twins in the movie, I was unaffected. Bored.I wondered why 217 was 237, why a gin martini was bourbon on the rocks, why Danny's broken arm was a dislocated shoulder. It was, at best, annoying. I suppose a lot is determined on what is experienced first: the movie or the novel. Still, I will forever remember reading The Shining. I have already forgotten Jack Nicholson.",5

I was definitely not disappointed! I love when people who are famous, super funny, really polished, come off perfectly put together, etc. really show a vulnerable and relate-able side to them. Who knew she had such a tough & heart-wrenching childhood? I'm a firm believer that we all have an incident or season of our life from when we were younger and if we don't properly heal from that time in our lives, we emotionally don't mature past that age until we do. Chelsea walks us through her journey of personal healing to do just that. She had a handful of difficult experiences that impacted the way she perceived and reacted to situations throughout her life as aftermath. She was still funny but raw, personable and I felt for her as she let us into a piece of her life she hasn't before.

It was easy to navigate key moments in our common history: the war with Mexico, the Compromise of 1850, Reconstruction, machine politics of the 1880s, the rise of Teddy Roosevelt, the corruption of the Harding years, World War II, civil rights, and Vietnam. This is more than just a book about people who were never supposed to be president. The book is a brilliant refresher course in American history that should be required reading. Cohen does an impressive job in both teaching history and making it interesting. He finds the right balance between history and interpretation. The counterfactual lessons and what-ifs really come out in this riveting book.",5
"4363","The Island of Sea Women: A Novel","Matriarchy! Diving! History! Lisa See does it again - great story, interesting history","Littoral Librarian","1501154850","R277HA4AUMSH9V","1555670294","As I noted when I read Lisa See’s The Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane, I have loved reading her books for years, with my favorites including Shanghai Girls, Dragon Bones and Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. I was particularly pleased when, thanks to Scribner and NetGalley, I had the opportunity to read an advance copy of The Island of Sea Women, described as a book about “female friendship and family secrets on a small Korean island.”The island is Jeju, “…an island known for Three Abundances: wind, stones, and women.” The story centers on Mi-ja and Young-sook, two young girls living on the island who are best friends despite coming from very different backgrounds. When they are old enough, they begin working in the sea with their village’s all-female diving collective.Early on, the story of the women was so fascinating I had to take a break and do a bit of research into the Korean island of Jeju. OMG, these women really did exist and are unreal. And this is something I love about Lisa See’s books: I always learn so much about both culture and history, as Ms. See takes her meticulous research and weaves it into a story so seamlessly it has a powerful two-pronged impact: lots of learning combined with a terrific story involving complex relationships.The story of the Sea Women begins in 1938, at a time when Korea “…had now been a Japanese colony for twenty-eight years.” The  story moves from Japanese colonialism in the 1930s and 1940s through World War II, the Korean War, and into years of progress including cell phones and wet suits for the women divers. Mi-ja and Young-sook find their differences are impossible to ignore.  One big issue is that Mi-ja is the daughter of a Japanese collaborator, and this association will be with her forever.  Young-sook was born into a long line of haenyeo (women divers), her mother is the leader of the women’s’ diving collective,and Young-Sook is destined to inherit her mother’s position down the line.As usual when reading a Lisa See novel, it was so interesting to look at a completely different world, in this case one where the women are in charge as their day-to-day existence takes them into physically demanding and dangerous work while the men of Jeju take care of the children.It’s  a classic Lisa See story, focusing on friendship between while examining the larger forces that are swirling around them.  Fans of Lisa See will love this, anyone interested in Japanese/Korean history and culture will appreciate it, and those unfamiliar with either are in for a treat. I only gave Teagirl 4 stars due my feelings about the ending, but this one gets 5 stars.",5

"4365","Pet Sematary: A Novel","King's masterpiece -- and one of my favorite books","John Ratliff","198211598X","R1C2OULXGUI0T6","1555670725","I first read this book in 1980, at the recommendation of a coworker.  I'd stayed away from Stephen King ... too popular for my advanced tastes.  Anyway, I decided to take a look at the book about 10 PM (on a work night).  Finished it about 7 AM the next morning.  No book has ever taken over my  imagination like this, before or since.Since then, I've read all of  King's work, and consider him the contemporary Dickens.  But having just  reread the Shining for, perhaps, the fourth time, it remains my favorite,  and a modern masterpiece, in my opinion.But I recognize this is  essentially personal.  I've not identified with any other character is  literature as I do with Jack Torrance.  I'm now more than ten years into  sobriety and recovery, and I've often recommended this book to men that I  sponsor.  The depiction of the alcoholic personality, the combination of  fear and resentment and self-pity, at war with Jack's very real love for  his family and desire for goodness, is expressed in a way that makes it  clear that King is writing of something he knows all too well on a personal  level.  Jack Torrance is one of literature's great tragic figures.  I can  only say, ""There but for the grace of God go I.""[By the way,  this is why I can't abide by Kubrick's interpretation.  There's no tragedy  or complexity in Nickleson's portrayal of Torrance.  Kubrick's detachment  from the human delemma ultimately doesn't work for me.]I do believe that  there is a coherent force/power of evil/darkness in the world, though it is  not as powerful that the force/power of good/light.  But I think one of  King's most basic points (in all his work) is that we ignore the power of  darkness at our own risk, that this is one of the real problems in the  contemporary Age of Therapy.  Central to the Shining is the way the force  of the evil in the Hotel is able to utilize Jack's weaknesses ultimately to  turn him to its purposes--to destroy what he love the most.  I find this  very, very realistic (viewing the supernatural stuff as kind of window  dressing).Having reached out for help in a way that the Torrance  character couldn't, I'm now blessed with a life happier than I could  imagine.  But this book now reminds me of how much Divine Grace is involved  for anyone blessed with the ability to build healthy loving relationships  with those around him/her, especially family members, one day at a time.",5

The instrumented system allowed a real-time three dimensional look at what was happening, live in the air as it was happening.  And when those air crews came back to debrief, the data recorded live was there to show them what went right, and more importantly what went wrong.Cubic went on to develop amazing updates to this first 4 aircraft Yuma system. First to 8 aircraft/4 missile simulation system then to 36 aircraft/50 simulation with added air/ground and ground/air simulation capability.Todays system tracks 72 aircraft and 100 weapons simulations along with a fully integrated battle space environment incorporating real and virtual air and ground threat environments.  And yes, the F-35 plays a role in this environment.What's now called P5-TCTS undergirds not only Top Gun training, but the vaunted Red Flag large scale exercises at Nellis and in Alaska.I was a software developer for this amazing system from 1976 to 2008 and saw, and was part of this system during those years. This past year I sat down and wrote a short history of how ACMR grew along side the incredible advancement of computer technology.

Perhaps my perceptions of the characters were colored by the movie by Kubrick, but I feel the characters are so much better fleshed out.  In particular Halloran and Wendy just seemed way more vibrant especially compared to the movie version.  This is a great effort by Mr. King to do his take on the classic ""haunted mansion"" setting.  It does not dissappoint in any of the phases of execution.  What I love is how Mr. king can use the Hotel to give you a taste of particular times, as it feels it all blends together at the Overlook.  He does a great job handling all the diverse elements to make a pleasing blend.

"4396","The Trial of Lizzie Borden","Well-written piece of true crime!","Sarah Morrison","1501168371","RHB4HZC65HV9J","1555673566","Cara Robertson decides to focus a majority of this Lizzie Borden story on the trial itself. Lizzie Borden is being tried for the murders of her father and stepmother, Andrew and Abby Borden. Trigger warning: graphic details are given of the vicious crime. First of all, Robertson draws such a clear picture of the atmosphere of the courtroom and the interactions between the prosecutor and defense council that you feel like you are experiencing all of it in real time. She utilizes passages from journalists who were present, primarily Elizabeth Jordan (New York World) and Joe Howard (Boston Globe).Second, this trial gained such a following of intrigued spectators. They could not fathom that a woman could commit such a violent crime. The blows that killed Lizzie Borden's father and stepmother were numerous and excessive. Those in the courtroom could not reconcile the image of this hideous crime (the Andrew & Abby's skulls were literally on display) with the gentle image of Lizzie Borden. Also, she was criticized for her demeanor, which seemed unsuitable for a woman, because she didn't show emotion (cry) after the murders and very little in the courtroom. She was simply still and composed and that, to many spectators, meant guilty.Last of all, Robertson did a fantastic job reliving both the case against Lizzie Borden and her defense. Since Lizzie Borden's testimony and the interviews from pharmacists, stating that she tried to buy prussic acid (a poison) just a few days prior to the murder of Andrew & Abby Borden, were not permissible in court, there was not much evidence that Lizzie Borden committed the murders. There were no witnesses and not much if any evidence that tied her to the murders. There was just suspicion and a whole lot of it.Because I didn't know much about Lizzie Borden, the trial was a rollercoaster ride of emotions that all led up to a final climatic verdict. However, the story does not conclude with the verdict, so maybe that is the author's way of saying she too is unsettle by the conclusion. We may never know what truly happened the day that Andrew and Abby Borden were hacked to death, but there will always be theories.",5

Huff","198211598X","RNSWBW4E5ORQX","1555682157","It's not fair, but it's inevitable if you've seen the movie that you're going to compare the two versions.  As much as I love the movie, I really liked the elements of the book that Kubrick chose not to use.  I thought the background info on Jack was really great and *loved* that Wendy was made of a little stronger stuff than what we saw in the movie.  And I liked Hallorran's story more in the book as well.One thing I really enjoyed is how King took the old evil house story and elevated it.  The way he told the story was very successful at mixing in the character's thoughts and those coming from the Overlook into the main text.  I wasn't crazy about some of the stuff he did with Danny's thoughts (the spelling stuff seemed a little hokey), but overall it was a smart way to add to the story.Like it always seems with this genre, there was a flaw--the evil is almost always made out to be so powerful and pervasive, yet it is often defeated by rather mundane or convenient circumstances.  It wasn't an unscathed victory though, so I give King credit for that.",5

Fairly new to the psychological thriller genre, I read it in two days with a befitting glass of merlot on hand. I really liked quirky Anna's character from the get go, and felt deeply for this scarred, tortured recluse as the book progressed. I could not for the life of me  figure out who did it and I enjoyed  all the twists and turns. I also enjoyed AJ Finn's snarky first-person writing style, his sense of humor, choice of strong verbs, and the old movie references, many of which I've seen and now want to rewatch. I deducted one star (okay, just a half!) for the overuse of metaphors/similes as others have pointed out, especially since some of them made no visual or logical sense (ie. my robe is smeared across the floor like a skid mark), but they didn't slow down the book or lessen my enjoyment. The upcoming movie version promises to be great, and I'm eager to see who they will cast as Anna. With time, I believe AJ Finn will emerge as one of the best suspense writers around.

This is one of those books I couldn't put down and I was on the edge of my seat through the entire thing wondering what was next for Beatriz.

This story is full of so much drama, danger, and love that it's amazing taking it all in and looking for the next scenario to pop up. Beatriz is an inspiration. Her character is strong, vibrant, and so proud of her heritage. I loved that through the entire book she fought for the country she loved. Even when those priorities and the country changes, she still fights. This book has so much history in it as well. I loved that the author put in different parts from the period and they were so engaging and left you with so much pain in your heart for the souls that were lost. Beatriz has two of the most amazing men in this book that fight for her in a different way. I loved them both. Eduardo is such a good friend and he understands Beatriz in ways that no one else does. His character was suave and courageous and I hated everything he endured. Then Beatriz meets Nick and omg, it was instant love for me. His character is powerful, so full of heart and I wanted them together instantly. But this story isn't one of those where the two loves are instantly together. These two go through so much over the years and in the end no matter what path they take, it's a love that lives on forever. It was breathtaking and beautiful.

"4560","When We Left Cuba","An epic love letter to Cuba! Fantastic!","Rachel M","045149086X","RXQLPWC2AZY2Z","1555689740","If you loved Next Year in Havana and following Elisa Perez and her story of the revolution in Cuba, you will LOVE this book that tells the tale of the gorgeous, and enchantingly fiery Beatriz, Elisa's older sister, and how life goes on after the family moves to America. You do not need to read Next Year in Havana to enjoy this story as it stands really well on it's own (they both do!), but Chanel Cleeton's first book is FANTASTIC, so you probably should anyway!

Beatriz is a spitfire of a young woman, feisty and smart and uncompromising of her passions and beliefs. She turns down marriage proposals almost as often as she turns heads, and I was thrilled she got her own story for us to feast upon.

During the Cuban revolution, the Perez family has to quickly flee for their safety to America and as tensions run high between the two countries, Beatriz struggles to find her place in this foreign country she just cannot fathom ever calling home. Her beliefs and desire for revenge on Castro and his regime clash with her mothers wishes for her to settle down and marry, and she finds many of her choices in love and life seem to be doing nothing but causing shame upon the already crestfallen family.

Her determination to fight for her beloved home finds her in precarious situations after being recruited by the CIA to get into Castro's inner circle. But she knows she is exactly where she needs to be, doing what she has to do, and is steadfast to complete the ultimate task to salvage some of the life her family has lost. Strong-willed and resolute, she's careful not to let her guard fall, while simultaneously falling for an important man who seems just beyond her reach.

I am not a good non-fiction reader. I zone out. I lose attention quickly. It's only when a story like THIS comes along that I feel like I can actually absorb important history. The book is fiction, of course, but is inspired by tumultuous events and incidents such as Cuban-American tension, the Bay of Pigs, the missle crisis, and the Kennedy assassination.

It takes an incredible story and even more incredible character like Beatriz, along with Chanel's effortless writing, and I feel like I've been opened up to this magical country that seemed always so mysterious and closed off to the world. Through both of her books following these strong-willed Perez women, my eyes have been opened and my heart aches for the people of Cuba and everything they lost. Everything they could have had.

Beatriz is a character I won't forget for a long time. Her story is wildly impressive and her spirit is magnificent. When We Left Cuba is engrossing, and riveting, and will capture your heart from the very beginning - it's a dramatic and captivating historical saga, a gorgeous and delicious romance, and in the end - an exquisite love letter to Cuba.",5

"4566","Pet Sematary: A Novel","The book truly ""Shines""","Tsanche","198211598X","R1PGVGELMU8ALZ","1555690022","Nowadays it's really hard to be impressed with this book.  Perhaps because so many people have seen the movie they feel no need to pick up the book at all.  Well, I haven't seen the Stanley Kubrick movie, so when I read ""The Shining"" I had no expectations for it.If you saw the movie before reading the book, chances are (judging by these reviews) you won't like it as much because it isn't as ""scary"" as the movie.  Well, you can't really say the book is bad, even if you enjoyed the movie more.The Shining is about a man named Jack Torrance who takes his wife and son up to the Overlook hotel in Colorado to take care of it for the winter.  But his son Danny, has a gift.  This gift is called ""The Shining"".  The Shining allows Danny to read peoples minds, and see things that are beyond horror for his mind to comprehend.  The Overlook Hotel has a haunting past, and because of Danny's shining, he can see them.  Soon the hotel will control Jack and send him out of control and drive him mad.  But Danny and Wendy (the wife) are snowbound, and that means that when Jack does go insane, there will be no way out.It's easy to see how this is a classic.  It's often times said to be the scariest book King has ever written.Truthfully though, you've got to have patience when you read this book.  King spends a lot of time developing Jack, Wendy and Danny, and that makes this book a little more slowly paced than other books he's written.  Slow pace is by no means a bad thing, but The Shining for some may pace too slow.The book was enjoyable though, and while I don't believe it's the best thing King has written (my personal favorite is ""Misery""), but it is a remarkable classic.However, if you've seen the Kubrick film, I can't imagine many people enjoying this to the full extent.  The Kubrick film ruins most of the surprises and takes away from the suspense and horror (and the film is VERY different from the book).  The climax of the book, many may argue, is not as shattering as the films.  However, this shouldn't stop the read from being an enjoyable one.",5

"4598","The Priory of the Orange Tree: THE NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER","“All the world is a cage in a young girl's eyes.”","Mariah","1635570298","RHL5A2C4JUDY6","1555693480","I just need it said that I've been calling this book ""The Priority of the Orange Tree"" for months, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.I wanted to finish this yesterday because it was International Women's Day and this book is everything I have ever wanted to see in the Epic Fantasy genre since I was a little girl - but you know what they say about the best laid plans of mice and (wo)men. I digress.From the very beginning this book pulled me in and I held on for dear life. The world building felt natural and progressed at a pace that kept me interested in the plot but not overwhelmed. Shannon weaved a beautiful web from Eastern and Western mythology, and infused it with this badass womanly energy that makes me so excited to see the ripple effect.“We may be small, and we may be young, but we will shake the world for our beliefs.”The book changes POVs from place to place instead of character, so you get glimpses of what is going on in the East, West and South as the story progresses. What I found so interesting in this book is that usually, when I deal with a POV change I'm annoyed because I wanna see everything play out, or I like one character better, but in Priory everything was just so well timed and executed to perfection.Can I also say, props to the author for making this standalone and a self-contained story in itself and not dragging it out in book after book just to cash grab like a lot of authors choose to do. And there is so much beauty in the fact that this is one gorgeous tale on its own. It is magical, and powerful, and dramatic, and an adventure from beginning to end.I think there is something so unique in fantasy that is unlike any other genre, where anything is possible and we are not bound by the boring and often stifling constrictions and preconceived notions. If there are dragons and wyrms and magic than why not Queendoms, and societies where the women are the ones trained to fight, and it is just as common for a man to marry another man than it is for him to marry a woman.I really don't want to say too much about the story because I find so much joy in walking into a brand new world. But I looked back on my updates while I was reading this and this is what I experienced: goosebumps, edge of your seat excitement, awe when faced with such beautiful storytelling skill, surprise as nothing went down how I thought it would, shock because HOLY. MORTHERFORKING. SHIRTBALLS. BATMAN, and just so much contentment in knowing there's a book like this out there now. (less)",5

Though this is a work of fiction the way Ms. Cleeton writes makes this story feel so real. Actual events mixed with a story that, may not have a conventional love story, it will have you falling in love. You also see Beatriz in a light that I have always pictured the women in my family to be in. As a daughter of Cuban immigrants this story really hits home to me. Although my grandparents journey was a little different the feelings and emotions described were shared by everyone who was forced to flee their home during that time. I can not say it enough Ms. Cleeton's words with this story and the one before (Next Year In Havana) will forever be in my heart. ABSOLUTELY A MUST READ!",5

The story begins in 1912 when Sofya and her sister Luba are spending time with Eliza Ferriday, Sofya's longtime friend and cousin while their father is honeymooning with their new stepmother, Agnessa. The story then moves to 1914 when the Russian Revolution begins. Each chapter features either Eliza, Sofya, or Varinka, a peasant girl who becomes nanny to Sofya's son Max, while the story travels between the United States, Russia and Paris.

The characters remain rich and interesting and I immediately felt like I was among friends. The descriptions of the Blitz are lean yet horrifying -- they do not overwhelm, but instead provide a sense of the relentlessness of the siege and the constant terror of living in London. My heart stopped mid-way through the book (SPOILER ALERT) when Priscilla is injured rescuing children from a burning building. I wanted to rush to her side along with Maisie.

This book was a clunky, choppy, not even greatly written mess. It randomly goes back and forth in time, in the middle of chapters, with no reference points to help the reader establish to what the author is referring. The sheer number of names mentioned makes it virtually impossible to remember their context. Even worse, this seemed to be less about this serial killer's rapes and murders, and more about the geography/history of various California towns. It felt like a book of very little substance, but a whole lot of filler.I'm the first to admit that nonfiction books aren't my thing. Having said that, I've read several true crime novels, particularly those by Ann Rule, and really enjoyed them. At the very least, the Ann Rule books appeared to be organized and...I don't know...edited, perhaps? Yes, I realize only half this book was completed before Michelle McNamara tragically passed away in 2016, and I'm certain that accounts for a great deal of the disorganized content. Nevertheless, these are issues which should have been addressed prior to publishing.Don't get me wrong, Ms. McNamara clearly did her research. It's a very studied novel...it's just not a coherent one. And I can't help but feel many readers were probably more interested in Michelle's story than in the EAR/ON's. I know I was.If I'm being completely real, my favorite parts of the book were the introduction, written by author Gillian Flynn, and the afterword, written by McNamara's husband, actor/author Patton Oswalt. I also enjoyed the pictures of the victims and detectives placed at the end of the novel, but felt their placement would have been far more effective within the chapters where they were described.Bottom line, if you like true crime, you might like I'll Be Gone in the Dark. Or you might not. I certainly didn't.",2

If I hadn’t paid $10, I probably would have just put it down completely.

You have some moments of deja vu from 50 Shades (dance with me, now what are you going to do with me, etc). It felt a little uninspired. The Sister-in-law “Caro” thing (dumb nickname) was pointless and if you took it all away, it didn’t impact the story at all. It was annoying and just tossed in there with no real commitment behind it. You get the point toward the end but it’s just glossed over and insignificant by then.

I thought I would get hooked in the first chapter like I did with 50 shade of grey but I was disappointed. I can not even finish the book. There is no real character development so we don’t really know these characters, nor do we get a chance to really come to like them. Very unbelievable plot. I like love at first sight stories but this one was just to unbelievable to me. I hope she comes out with something better next time because book does no justice for E.L James as an author. I kind of feel like she just threw something together so her readers would think that she is still relevant as an author.

Now with REDEMPTION we are able to see him deal with something that is not really part of his profile: the possibility of being wrong.

This book takes us into his grappling with the fact that he might have been instrumental in sending a man to prison that is actually innocent, and with the clock racing against them both Decker goes back to either prove he was right or to right a wong.

Through the book there are the usual interactions we have come to know with Decker and some of the other characters. With Sally we get reminders of how he is viewed by others, and even by himself. But we also get the somber moments when he reflects on what he has lost and what really drives him: the search for truth.

Will he be able to show he got it right or will he be allowed to free an innocent man and make sure a killer is brought to justice? That is the road we travel in REDEMPTION, and each chapter prepares you for the surprises that are to come.",5

In Lilac Girls we met Carolyn Ferraday, Lost Roses is the story of Carolyn's mother, Eliza Ferraday and two other women. Sofya Streshnayva is a Romanov cousin and friend of Eliza's, and Varinka is a young peasant girl that ends up working for Sofya. These three ladies have very differing paths through World War I and the Russian Revolution. Lost Roses travels from the US and Russia to Paris at the end of World War I. It is mainly the story of the Russian Revolution and how the tide turned against Little Father and anyone associated with him. In the chaos that ends at the end of the war and the revolution some friends are mourned and some are found. Another beautiful story By Martha Hall Kelly. #Netgalley #LostRoses",5

"4745","Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed","Loved it!","spanakopita NJ","1328662055","R2OFWH5ZOGCTHK","1555707773","I loved this honest and moving memoir of Lori Gottlieb's. Having previously read her book about settling in marriage, I wasn't sure what to expect, and I feel like this gave me a whole new perspective on her. Gottlieb became a therapist after a couple of other careers, and in her mid-forties, decides to see a therapist herself after a devastating and unexpected breakup. The book alternates chapters between her work with ""Wendell,"" a therapist referred to her by one of her professional colleagues, and her work with several key patients. Over the course of the book, we see her patients learn, evolve, and start healing, while Lori herself does the same through her work with Wendell.

It's difficult to write nonfiction in a storylike manner that flows, and Gottlieb has done this perfectly. We gradually uncover her layers as we do with her patients, and everything is paced correctly so that you don't lose track of individual patients or Gottlieb's own issues. I really felt like I knew and sympathized with all of her patients, as well as Gottlieb herself (the story of Julie touched me in particular).

Throughout the book, Gottlieb reminds us that therapists are also only human, which I think is an important point to remember (and one that I never really focused on before). Even if you have never been to or considered therapy, I think anyone could get a lot out of this book. Definitely recommended!",5

I haven’t been able to put this book down because it is diffidently a page turner filled with golden nuggets of wisdom. I especially love Chapter 9 page152 where Bishop T.D.

He was working on my nervousness. He was working on my motives. He was working on my wisdom.

Look no further.A Chicago family moves into a small town in Maine. Near their home, there is a patch of land that even the Native Americans used to think was evil, and which brings about a sense of foreboding even now. Near that land, there is a ""Pet Sematary,"" where the children of the town traditionally bury their pets. There's an older neighbor who warns that the cursed land is best avoided. There's also a lonely highway that goes past their new home, upon which massive trucks build up dangerous levels of speed.These elements are scary in their own right, but the kicker is that when living things are buried in the cursed ground, they come back. And when they come back, they are different, and different in a bad way. Depending on how much time has passed between their death and their burial, they might be near-normal, or completely evil. In all cases, they bear a whiff of the grave about them like an earthy shroud.This is just a great scary book, and we really come to love the characters, and agonize over the decisions that they are confronted with. It is depressing, even shockingly depressing in parts, but I still have to recommend it wholeheartedly.King employs one of his trademark devices here to great effect, and that is that he first gives you some second or third-hand accounts of supernatural phenomena occuring that sound very believable. This not only sets the reader up to believe in the supernatural phenomena as they are happening, but it also enhances the sense of wonder as we personally come into contact with something that we have heard about before in legends.I would say that this book is almost too brutal and heartbreaking for it to serve as an introduction into King's work. In so many of his works, we are treated to a battle between the forces of good and evil. But in Pet Sematary, good seems to have taken a vacation, leaving us with a battle between evil and not-up-to-the-task.If you've already gotten used to how terrifying King can be, then I recommend this book to experience the depths of his depravity.",5

It is a prequel to Lilac Girls and tells the story of Caroline Ferriday's mother, Eliza. The book takes place from 1914 to 1920, The book is divided into chapters titled with the 3 main characters, Eliza, Sofya and Varinka. Sofya is a cousin to the Tsarina and a member of the Russian aristocracy in 1914. Varinka is a peasant girl who goes to work as a nanny to Maxwell, Sofya's son. Eliza is a friend of Sofya's family and lives in New York and Connecticut. The Russian entrance into WWI and subsequent revolution change Sofya's and Varinka's life forever.
I enjoyed this book and found it to be an accurate portrayal of life in Russia, France and the US during this period. My wife read this book before me and was appalled at the way the Russian aristocracy treated the peasants. She did not like it as much as Lilac Girls. But I found it to be an honest portrait of the corruption and extravagant lifestyle that led to the revolution.
Some quotes:
""How is the tsar helping?""
I shrugged. ""He believes if he supports the rich, prosperity will trickle down to the people.""
Eliza meeting an actor: ""Had he marinated himself in cologne?""
""When I went back to the house I found it in Agnessa's ruined townhouse. Kept it alive since I left Russia.""
Luba stroked a petal. ""Poor lost roses. Liked us, I suppose.""

"4888","Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn and World War II","Dutch Girl","Maria-Anne","1732273537","RKNPNOBBEXQEQ","1555718295","The story of one of the most enduring and beloved stars Hollywood has ever produced -- Audrey Hepburn -- has been told again and again since her passing in 1993. An Amazon search of books with her name will produce well over a thousand titles, with every aspect of her life but one covered in print: her years during World War II when she lived in the Netherlands under Nazi rule.

On April 15, 2019 -- just weeks before what would’ve been her 90th birthday -- critically acclaimed and bestselling biographer Robert Matzen reveals the true war story of this cinematic icon. The book, as shocking as it is vital and triumphant, is DUTCH GIRL: AUDREY HEPBURN AND WORLD WAR II

As soon as I saw this book, I knew I had to read it! I've been a big fan of Audrey Hepburn for a long time and I'm always interested in reading about her life. This isn't just a biography of Audrey Hepburn but a biography of the time and place that made her who she was. I found it to be well researched and nicely put together.

This beautifully researched and written book chronicles the early life of actress/dancer Audrey Hepburn in the Netherlands in World War II. Though she spent some of her early years in England, she returned to Velp and Arnhem in the Netherlands right before the German occupation. Towards the end of the war, Audrey and three relatives took refuge in the cellar as one of the last major battles of the war raged right above them.

""Dutch Girl,"" in one sense, is a tale of one small Dutch town's experiences during the Nazi occupation. Historians and those who enjoy historical case studies will find this book riveting. The fact that the ""main character"" of the book turns out to be an A-list Hollywood actress is almost an aside.

"4919","Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, HER Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed","Misleading and Upsetting","spanakopita NJ","1328662055","R3YKS5JA9WIFB","1555721513","Why is this book receiving such good reviews? There's nothing realistic, informative, or even entertaining about it. The author talks (and talks and talks) about herself, and seems to think she's charming. She isn't.

My daughter fought hard to become a respected psychotherapist. She wanted to help people. But once she began seeing clients, she lasted less than a year before ""coming to her senses"" and opening a bakery where she didn't ""have to throw up every night from dealing with damaged people"" (the other therapists, not the patients).

And I've been in and out of therapy since the early sixties, when I was a teenager. It was never my idea. It was always because someone said ""maybe you should talk to someone."" And I never went to whine about my boyfriend/fiance' deciding he didn't want to deal with my child for ten years. I was in crisis. A violent physical attack, loss of a child, a life-threatening illness, and so on. I never got help. I never felt safe in a therapist's office. On the occasions I tried to ""open up"" to someone, I either blatantly was judged (and typically condemned), or the therapist seemed (and not just to me) to be a distracted crackpot.

This book is so frighteningly unrealistic, I'm concerned people will either think seeking ""professional"" therapy might be a good time (it isn't), or something to just give a try (which could be entertainment for those with the money to spend, but might also be dangerous because when your therapist directly insults you or gasps and tells you how wrong you are, it can have a profound effect on you).

The author also must be the worst of the worst. It took her how long to discover that one male patient had a softer side (love for his dog)? Barbara Walters broke through Aristotle Onassis's rock-hard shell in less than ten minutes with one clear way in to his psyche; it doesn't have to take forever, although at (at least in Los Angeles) one hundred and eighty to four hundred dollars for forty to fifty minutes truly is a great way for therapists to drag it out and pocket the change. And it honestly is not funny that the author of this book showed up for work in a pajama top. If she can't get and keep her own life together better than that, she shouldn't expect to have return patients or to get paid. In fact, she shouldn't be licensed to practice.

I just can't say enough negative things about this book. In my own analysis, the author is narcissistic, incompetent, and full of herself. She doesn't seem to want to ""help"" or even enlighten anyone. She admittedly started her career in the L.A. entertainment industry, and having lived my own working years exclusively in the L.A. entertainment industry, it sounds like sour grapes. I've seen people come here to Get Into The Business and, when they didn't get the attention or reach the level of importance they believed they deserved, ditched out and tried for something safer and more easily attainable, like psychotherapy.

Anybody can become a therapist. Half my high school graduating class went into psychology, at least for awhile (the other half became lawyers), and there is exactly one friend who stuck with it and actually seemed to want to do some good. So hey, if you want to write a book and need some fodder with which to fill your pages, therapy is as good a way to make yourself and others sound like an ass. And don't we all love to read about fools?

Not that the author is a complete fool. She was smart enough to use Big C Insurance by adding the running story of a patient dying of cancer, and cancer always sells. If that patient's story hadn't been included, this book wouldn't have sold one copy.",5

Snyder","145166883X","R3BQ2E2W0BPG0H","1555721722","This is moderately better than The Death of Caesar, but ultimately, I'm giving it the same 3-star rating.As one other reviewer noted (and other examples could be offered) Strauss tends to a high level of assumptions. A little of that comes with the territory, but he pushes the envelope.Second, Strauss's book is heavy on imperial reputation rehabilitation with some of his 10 featured candidates, above all with Nero. And, in Nero's case at least, methinks he doth protest too much.Related, why these 10? And, with Nero in particular, with the transitions Strauss has, why does he still write so little about Claudius. (More on Nero below.)Third? This is relatively lightweight. Just 300 pages, with fairly large type, for 10 emperors? It's like a Suetonius Starter Kit or Taciturn Tacitus or something.And, speaking of him as well as Nero?Strauss does little critical wrestling with Tacitus' statement about Nero persecuting Christians for the fire of Rome. No other Roman historian mentions it for another century afterward. (There were other Romans who likely wrote about the fire at the time, but their materials are not extant, so we don't know the Xn angle if it was written by them or not.) No pre-200 Christian mentions it.Next, the Christians/Chrestians issue. Given that Tacitus wrote in Latin, may not have known Greek well and likely was born in Gaul and may not have known Judaism well, his comments about Nero, Christians and the fire must be handled carefully.1. It's possible he's speaking of ""Messianic Jews"" in general; after all, he records this as why Claudius gave Jews the boot from Rome.2. He may, per Acts saying ""they were first called Christians in Antioch"" (without Acts telling us WHEN), be using secondhand sources of some sort.And, while most scholars accept the passage as genuine, it could be like Josephus and have a genuine core but some extrapolations around that.And, that, in turn, is the problem with the lightness of this book.(My inclination is that it is at a minimum, ""not proven"" that Tacitus is talking about Christians rather than Messianic Jews —or that he's not relying on secondary sources besides the Romans like Pliny the Elder who may have written at the time. Or that he's not relying on something Christian.)There's other reasons for this. A good estimate is that Rome probably had no more than 1,000 Christians in 64CE. That's out of a total population that was probably approaching 1 million by then. (The city's population didn't peak, in all likelihood, until the 2nd century, and at more than 1 million.)That's 1/10th of 1 percent. Hardly enough to even be on Nero's radar screen, one would think. Imagine an American president going nuts about Bahais in Washington DC, for example. The Jewish population, even focusing on those prodding Messianic issues? Probably 5,000 or more. And, a Jewish Messianist persecution by Nero would have been lost in the Jewish revolt.Next? An over the top claim about languages that were ""as likely"" (quote) to be spoken in Trajanic Rome as Latin. Greek? Sure. Lumping different languages of Western Europe as ""Celtic""? Likely. Aramaic? Not so likely. Hebrew? Not at all as likely to be spoken in Rome as Latin.Oh, and ""German,"" to riff on ""Celtic""? There was no such language 2,000 years ago. There was ""Gothic,"" we could say, and there was ""proto-Germanic."" Nope, no ""German,"" though.And, an academic professor of ancient European history should know that. And also not to claim Hebrew was as common in Rome as Latin.That dropped it to a sure three stars. If I were really generous and we were offered them, maybe a 3.5. But likely not.",3

I have to say that I don't recommend this one. The journey is just not worth it in the end. King's character details are amazing at first but by page 300 you start to get really tired of it. The only thing scarier than room 217 is Chapter 38 absolute snooze fest for quite a few pages only to give you two bits of information that could have been delivered in two paragraphs and been just as interesting. To be fair I have to say that the highs in this book are awesome. If you like intense and thrilling scenes this book delivers its just that they are few and far between. King says his second draft is 1st draft minus 10%, I recommend -25%. The book is just too long for what it gives you in return. What really surprises me is that for the first 300 pages I was stoked on this book and telling people to read it, but now I'm getting to the end and I can't wait to be done with it. Perhaps King struggled with his ending and I'm feeling it, but I don't think so the book should just end way earlier than it does.

The family is excited to get a fresh start and live a simpler life than they did in the city. Their new home is in close proximity to a pet cemetery which they find humorous at first but as the months pass the Creeds are unwittingly drawn into a tenebrous world of ancient burial grounds and necromancy.I didn't expect to enjoy this book because the title seemed childish but it was very interesting. King uses the supernatural to highlight the different ways people feel about death and handle the grieving process.The mythology on which the book relies was not explained or developed in enough detail which became frustrating particularly towards the end. This was also disappointing because the premise is very good and King starts off promisingly but his execution falters as the book progresses. The biggest problem with this book is that it is just not scary. A lot of the scary sections just fell flat and also lacked creativity.",3

"5034","After (The After Series)","Draining","RR Reviews","1982111003","R28YBHS3QYF89T","1555731302","I just couldn't get through this book. Quite frankly, I'm baffled at all the high reviews. This book literally drained me to read.First let's start with the fact that the characters read far younger than they are. Tessa reads more 16 than a college student and Hardin doesn't read close to 20 which he would be as a second year student.  Tessa's internal monologue was grating and the constant screaming and use of exclamation marks was just—well let's just say I would rather stick bamboo in my fingernails then continue reading.On to the next point which may contain spoilers so skip this if you don't want anything spoiled. Neither character had any redeemable qualities. I read a lot about it being a toxic relationship and people putting the blame on Hardin, but let's be honest, Tess is just as bad. What this book boils down to is sex and not love. After Hardin constantly treating her like crap she always runs back and guess what they do? Yup, fool around.  So I repeat, that's not love, that's lust. For instance: After getting in a big fight with Hardin (and after cheating on her boyfriend for weeks) Tessa calls her BF and begs him to skip out on school and drive 3 hours to see her just to piss Hardin off. Once he gets there, she ditches him the second Hardin ""needs her"" then proceeds to take her boyfriend's car and stay the night with Hardin without telling her BF. Then proceeds to screw around with Hardin. Things obviously blow up the next day but then she gets back with her boyfriend to once again cheat on him and then dump him. These are HER actions, nothing Hardin pushes, in fact he tells her she's pathetic and stupid for breaking it off with him.Then there is a crap ton of back and forth. Seriously, they fight every chapter and considering most chapters are below 1,500 words that's draining.The final blow is the fact that the writing is crap. Very choppy and the lack of contraction makes the writing seem odd. Most people won't say ""I will take you. they'll say ""I'll take you."" I don't mind it in the narration, but when people are talking it should sound like people are talking.In the end, I made it to 65% which is pretty good considering I had to stop frequently. I'm really not sure how this is so popular and why just like 50 shades, they are making a movie which will obviously be terrible because the source material is terrible. (Speaking of 50 shades, there are so many plot points taken from there it literally made me roll my eyes.) I did skip to the end and the way it ends is so contrived I just can't. At almost 600 pages you would think more would actually happen.So, if you like characters with actual substance, then skip this book. If you want to read constant yelling then screwing around with no underlying ANYTHING—then this is your book.",1

High","62824619","RUANHLXH9D3SL","1555739443","It's worth giving Greg Iles a pass on his politics to read this finely crafted novel.  After all, 50% of our population lies on either side of the line drawn in the sand.  The fact that I'm a conservative shouldn't require me to bash a liberal's work.""Cemetery Road"" is a well plotted multi-generational tale of small town corruption extending back to the Civil War.  Mr. Iles takes you on a fast-paced yet intricate ride through the politics and hidden agendas of Beinville, Mississippi, a small town that has somehow managed to hold its own while most other river towns have given up the ghost.  The ironic title of this novel works well here, covering the bases of each plot thread as it unravels -- from private family deceptions to those bringing collateral damage for everyone in the town.This timely premise involves a Chinese company finding a home for their new billion dollar factory in Bienville.  The large investment in this small town will bring prosperity to a lot of the local population as well as improving highway access that will also expand the local community.  But the biggest beneficiaries of all will be members of the Bienville Poker Club, a group of corrupt businessmen who ancestors have controlled Bienville since The Reconstruction(1865-1877).However there is a dangerous complication, something that would cause all of their investments to collapse on them.  The site of the new factory has been partially excavated by an amateur archeologist who believes that the site was the home of a native culture occupying it 4,000 years ago.  Pursuing protection for this historical site will cause all of the Poker Club's complicated manipulations to go up in smoke -- and the local population to lose all of the benefits and amenities they are counting on.As always, Greg Iles delivers a well researched and fast moving novel with stark narrative and intricate personal relationships.  Not all is what it seems to be but suffice it to say that not every player trusts even his/her closest associates/relatives.  It appears to be ""all for one and one for all"", until suddenly it doesn't.  More complicated then his previous works, the issues here range from interpersonal relationships to international issues.  Well worth your time!",5

And he’s having a lend of us, the reader. If that’s not obvious from the title and the characters, then the cases they deal with should confirm it. Those characters, though, do give him enormous scope for insightful observations and wise words.

The DoSC consists of Carl (incredibly conscientious), Erik (obsessed by fishing), Ulf (kind and sensitive and in impossible love with his married colleague), Anna. The annoyingly enthusiastic but less than competent Officer Blomquist also lends a hand. And let’s not forget Martin, Ulf’s deaf, depressed, lip-reading dog, Mrs Hogfors, his neighbour and Dr Svensson, his therapist.

The cases, passed on from Malmö’s Criminal Investigation Authority because they are slightly unusual, are also a rich source of material for philosophical discussion: an unwitnessed stabbing in the back of a knee; a missing boyfriend who’s imaginary; and a possible werewolf. As Ulf and his team carry out their investigations, they are extremely prone to heading off on (often amusing) tangents during questioning. All are successfully resolved, but not without much deep discussion of the behaviours encountered.

McCall Smith’s characters discuss, debate and ponder topics as diverse as imaginary friends, politically correct terminology for small people, the canine environmental footprint, osmotic knowledge, vegan objection to pets and whether the obsessed can be happy.

When Ulf muses on gentlemanly behaviour, it’s very pertinent to the current “me too” cases: “...although he knew that nobody talked about being a gentleman any more, the concept still existed somewhere under the burden of the new language of relationships, the language that stressed self-determination and personal space. That was not all that different from the code of gentlemanly conduct that had previously prevented men from inappropriate conduct in their relations with women. The things that men were now supposed not to do were precisely the things that gentlemen were not meant to do anyway - so what was the difference? Were we simply becoming old-fashioned again, as societies tended to do when they saw the consequences of tearing up the behavioural rule book?”

While it sounds like a crime novel, McCall Smith describes it as Scandi Blanc (as opposed to Scandi Noir) and anyone who is reading his work for the crime aspect has the wrong end of the stick: McCall Smith’s crime books are an exercise in examining human behaviour and the gentle philosophy which that inspires. Delightfully tongue-in-cheek.",4

"5131","Pet Sematary: A Novel","Still King's Best, After All These Years","Bruce Rux","198211598X","R368GW0L6PDWM3","1555740873","King has written several fine novels, but The Shining is really his masterpiece.Jack Torrance is the quintessential screw-up.  He just can't seem to get anything in his life on track  -  ever since he broke his infant son's arm, while on one of his many alcoholic benders.  Jack can't hold a job, what with the booze and his unmanageable temper.  And with all these problems, Jack can't concentrate sufficiently to write the play he's wanted to write for years.Colorado's historic Overlook Hotel gives him just the chance he needs to redeem himself.  The hotel needs a caretaker through the winter months.  Jack could use the privacy for his writing, his wife Wendy looks forward to the cozy surroundings, and his son Danny has more than enough room to play in.  Neither Jack nor his family are concerned about the rumors that the Overlook is haunted  -  or that the former caretaker, Mr. Grady, went mad and bashed his wife and children to death with a roque mallet.No, they're not concerned  -  but they should be.  Because little Danny has an unusual psychic power, a special ""shine"" to him.  The kind of power that could manifest the Overlook's many violently-demised ghosts back into the world, to wreak even more mayhem than they did when they were alive, if they could just kill Danny so they could use it.  But with someone as emotionally unstable as Jack spending the winter with them, the disturbed spirits have hands to make that job just a little bit easier...The only flaw with this great novel is an occasional tendency to go over-the-top, but King does that far less here than in most of his other books, and not sufficiently for it to become a nuisance.  His writing is in peak form, and these are among the best and most realistic characters he's ever written.  The plot and the suspense never flag, building relentlessly.There are fewer than a handful of great ghost stories written in this century, but this is one of them.  If you've never read a King book in your life, but want to see what all the hoopla is about him, this is the one you want to read.  Don't miss it.  And don't assume it's at all like the Stanley Kubrick movie, because they're worlds apart.",5
"5133","The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You","An actually-useful book for first-time managers (and beyond)!","Wayne","735219567","RJKNGPJA964GL","1555741126","This is hands-down the book I wished I'd had when I began managing 8 years ago.  It definitely would have saved me from making countless & costly  mistakes during my first few years of management, and I will benefit from it greatly as a manager even now!What sets this book apart from other books about management is unlike other management books written by folks at the end of their careers, Julie still remembers her own ramp-up into management (due to her meteoric rise from intern to VP at Facebook in less than a decade).  Julie's complete honesty about all her fears, insecurities, and mistakes at the time (and how she continued to experience them throughout her career) makes her the reader's relatable management confidant and her lessons far more potent.Julie is a masterful storyteller and effective teacher, seamlessly weaving together her own management war stories to illustrate core principles, combined with practical & easy-to-remember frameworks for managers to use.  Each chapter opens with a cute illustration cementing a key idea from the management topic to be discussed.  While most of the book focuses on topics that will help first-time managers, later chapters touch upon topics that will help even seasoned managers, such as hiring and managing managers yourself and setting the culture of your organization.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about making the plunge into management, in their first few years of management, or even to experienced managers looking for a refreshing take on management.  This is a new gold standard for books on management.",5

I'm all for people reading, evern if the books can be of questionable quality but holy hell this is just embarrassing. It reads as if it were written by a 14 year old who was held back in the 8th grade, twice.  It's also incredibly repetitive. I mean, it literally repeats the same story beats for the first 3/4 of the book.  And it reads like domestic abuse how-to, which is bad (if you weren't sure). This is not a romance novel, it's testimony given at a murder trial as evidence of guilt.",1
